I`m Carl Azuz.  Happy to see you this Thursday.  There is some news expected out of \n \n Washington, DC today.  It concerns the Mueller Report, the special investigation by former FBI Director Robert Mueller.  It looked into \n \n alleged Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election of 2016.  The Justice Department already released a summary of the report to \n \n Congress, that happened last month.  It said the investigation did not find that the campaign of Donald Trump illegally conspired or coordinated with \n \n Russia.  The Mueller Report didn`t draw a conclusion about whether President Trump obstructed justice, if he illegally interfered with \n \n government work. \n \nBut the summary said the U.S. Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General both concluded that there wasn`t sufficient evidence that the president had \n \n done anything wrong.  So what`s happening today?  Well Democrats said the four page summary wasn`t enough.  They wanted to see the entire Mueller \n \n Report of more than 300 pages.  That`s expected to be released today, though it`s also expected to be redacted meaning parts of it will likely be \n \n edited or removed first.  CNN 10 is planning to follow up on this story next week. \n \n10 Second Trivia.  Which of these countries won its independence from Spain in 1811?  Brazil, Haiti, Venezuela, or Jamaica.  Only one of these \n \n countries that won its independence from Spain is Venezuela.  \n \nVenezuela`s leader is starting to let humanitarian aid into the country.  For years, President Nicolas Maduro has denied that there`s a crisis in \n \n Venezuela but this week his government allowed the Red Cross to make its first delivery there.  The United Nations estimates that more than 20 \n \n percent of Venezuelans are in desperate need of supplies like medicine.  With its economy in shambles, a CNN investigation just found that illegal \n \n drug trafficking through Venezuela is soaring.  The country accuses the U.S. and Colombia of trying to distract attention toward Venezuela to hide \n \n their own defeat in the war on drugs.  But Nick Paton Walsh found first hand how Venezuela is becoming a major currier of cocaine. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nNICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Below is a cocaine super highway enriching Venezuela`s corrupt elite by (ph) bringing \n \n coke to American streets.  These thin lines are secret pathways from Colombia`s cocaine farming heartland below, across into neighboring \n \n Venezuela.  From there billions of dollars of the drug are smuggled north in tiny planes, U.S. and regional officials told CNN aided by Venezuela`s \n \n army and elite.  The Colombian military we`re with don`t get any lower to stay out of the range of track (ph) and machine guns and talk to locals \n \n mostly through the leaflets they drop. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We`ve stopped drug flights out of Colombia he told me but not from places we don`t control.  \n \nWALSH:  He means Venezuela, just five miles away.  Below they think they`ve spotted a cocaine laboratory one of many fueling Venezuela`s role as a \n \n cocaine courier.  Which a CNN investigation has learned is booming just as the country collapses, 240 tons went from Colombia to Venezuela in 2018.  \n \n After a third (ph) in one year, a U.S. official told us which could fetch $40 billion on U.S. streets.  That traffic happening down below, one \n \n possible (inaudible) why do many in the Venezuelan army and government never (inaudible) give up on Nicolas Maduro . They`re simply making too \n \n much money. \n \nThe trade remains mostly secret inside Venezuela on the other side of the border here but we were able to learn more about these illegal routes in \n \n from recent defectors from the Venezuelan army border patrol.  And about how their officers ordered them to let cross specific trucks carrying \n \n cocaine.  For five years this sergeant got those orders often three times a week.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE TRANSLATED:  The cars that cross both weapons and drugs were pick ups and we would be told the color and make of the truck and \n \n when, usually just after dawn or dusk.  Everything was coordinated by the brigade commander.  He`d send a lieutenant to tell you what needed to cross \n \n and this was arranged high up above.  Those who didn`t agree were swapped out automatically.  \n \nWALSH:  He fled to here, Colombia when the pressure to comply got too much and his unit found themselves confined to base.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE TRANSLATED:  We were locked on the base.  The general would say, everyone must be with us.  Leave or speak against the \n \n government, you`ll get arrested.  They had us brainwashed with food handouts.  One night I couldn`t take it anymore.  I went home and told my \n \n wife, we leave for Colombia.  My son started crying and said, Dad what are we going to do?  But I knew if they stayed without me they`d be captured or \n \n interrogated.  \n \nWALSH:  Venezuelan state TV occasionally shows how their armed forces crack down on the trade here intersecting Mexican pilots that have previously \n \n rejected allegations their actually running the drugs.  And then they`ll respond to several requests for comment.  But a U.S. official has told CNN \n \n these flights are surging, they use to take off from the remote hidden runways in the southern Venezuelan jungle but in the last three years moved \n \n north a U.S. official told CNN to reduce flying time.  There used to be three a week but last year there were almost daily.  This year, they`ve \n \n seen as many as eight in a single day a regional official said using 50 hidden runways.  \n \nCNN has seen a confidential U.S. radar map approximately here that shows the sharp turn left of planes from Venezuela take before landing on the \n \n remote Central American coast line off of Honduras before the cocaine travels north through Mexico to the United States.  Honduras is where we \n \n pick up the trail of this booming traffic again on the coastline below turned into a surreal graveyard of narco planes.  Cocaine cargo they carry \n \n is worth so many millions the plane itself is just a fraction in a billion dollar deal.  So, many are discarded (inaudible) all over the jungle or \n \n crammed here into one river bend. \n \nThe troops we`re with don`t want to be on camera for their safety.  Some of these have their markings torn off to make the job of working exactly where \n \n they come from even harder.  America`s drug habit is where the money, the route (ph), all begins.  But that same open market also supplies a key part \n \n of the logistics here.  When the fires deprived most of this plane of kind of distinguishing characteristics but you can still see N4 there.  N \n \n meaning this plane originated in the United States.  Brokers, a U.S. official tells me, buy up dozens of old planes at auction in the United \n \n States and hide their ownership in shell companies to send them south to start the cocaine journey north from Venezuela. \n \nAgain, another N, which means another plane that started its days in the United States.  It`s not just traffickers in Venezuela and the U.S. making \n \n billions, the entire region is in on it.  This is surely Honduras` biggest industry, the billions at stake everywhere.  From this jungle road which is \n \n actually a hidden runway up to the Honduran president`s brother indicted last year on trafficking charges which he denies.  You can`t stop the \n \n planes being sold or taking off one officer tells me.  So they instead just have to try and make landing harder by blowing holes in the runways.  Just \n \n in slowing down this multibillion dollar trade requires so many more holes to be blown in this vast expanse of jungle. \n \nThe amounts of money cocaine brings here literally dwarfs any effort to fight it.  Insane amounts of cash and to some villages along this coastline \n \n that have none.  In fact, the Honduran army tells us traffickers flying towards these villages often kick their cargo overboard when they think \n \n they`re about to be intercepted.  Each 30 kilogram bundle of cocaine is attached to floats and then drifts ashore.  They then pay these communities \n \n of fishermen $150,000 for each recovered bundle.  It`s calculus for corruption that most officials I spoke to admit they (inaudible) and that \n \n no police or aid operation can really hope to challenge. \n \nOne that sees the collapsing Maduro government has the alleged couriers cashing in  fast in a region of desperate (inaudible). \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)   \n \nAZUZ:  At first this will look like your run of the mill pontoon boat hanging out on a lake.  Nothing really unusual here until we zoom out and \n \n now you see the problem.  There was no one aboard the boat.  No lives were threatened here.  Officials believe that recent severe storms in the area \n \n caused the boat to break loose and drift to the edge of a dam.  Once the weather calmed down, wildlife officers used an electric wench to pull the \n \n boat back to shore. \n \nAll hands on deck to stop a &quot;shipwreck&quot;, to keep the &quot;boat afloat&quot;, a &quot;tact to stay intact&quot;.

There was a lot saved.  The two towers and facade at the front, what many people envision when they think of Notre Dame, they`re \n \n still standing.  A Paris city hall spokesperson says the cathedrals most significant treasures were saved including what Notre Dame calls its most \n \n precious and venerated relic.  A crown of thorns which many believe is the crown of thorns that was placed on the head of Jesus Christ.\n \nThe chaplain of the Paris fire service is being called a hero for rescuing that and other artifacts and the cathedrals great organ is safe.  Scores of \n \n the relics that survived were taken to the Louvre Museum, what was lost the cathedral`s spire, large parts of its roof and it`s ancient vaulted \n \n ceiling.  The central part of the building was damaged.  The Paris Fire Brigade says it`s not known yet what caused the fire.  A French government \n \n spokesman says it could be months before the full scope of the damage is known and a restoration expert expects it will take 10 to 15 years to fully \n \n rebuild Notre Dame. \n \nThe Vatican has offered its technical expertise in restoring the medieval catholic church and as far as funding goes, French philanthropists and \n \n businesses have pledged more than $700 million in donations to restore the cathedral.  That gives you one sense about what Notre Dame means to France.  \n \n Here`s another.  Victor Hugo`s novel, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; became the best selling book on Amazon France shortly after the fire took place.  \n \n A different edition of the same novel was the second best selling book, for a third sense of the building`s significance here`s CNN`s Phil Black. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nPHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  How do you measure the profound value of one old building to a nation or to the world?  Perhaps when people stop in \n \n the street to weep and pray because of its partial destruction, when the French president openly shares that grief. \n \nFRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON:  (untranslated)\n \nBLACK:  And efforts to save it are broadcast everywhere.  Notre Dame is among the most famous of famous buildings, 13 million people visit it every \n \n year.  Countless more stand before it, tilt their heads up and gaze at the extraordinary vertical scale. The vast rose windows and the many ornate \n \n sculptures guarding its exterior.  Gargoyles, saints and angels, all the features that make it a masterpiece of the Gothic style but few visitors \n \n saw this. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (untranslated)\n \nBLACK:  A 2018 special broadcast by local network France Deux (ph) showed these images, the centuries old woodwork supporting the roof.  There`s so \n \n much oak here its known as the forest of Notre Dame.  The same timber structures that would just a few months later feed a fire that threatened \n \n to destroy the whole cathedral.  Notre Dame, Our Lady of Paris has stood since the 1200s`.  A building in constant evolution as artists and \n \n craftsmen altered and repaired the structure and its decorations.  The towering timber spire now a loss to the flames was added in the 1800s`.  \n \nOften a symbol and reflection of French political power, the cathedral was vandalized through the French Revolution while Napoleon Bonaparte used it \n \n to reinstate monarchic rule with his coronation as Emperor.  Later, French Republican leaders, the nations presidents were honored here too.  This \n \n service was for military hero and statesman Charles de Gaulle.  Notre Dame survived the violence and the occupation of war.  More recently terrorist \n \n attacks in Paris saw it become a focus for the nations grief. \n \nAn inspiration for artists across many art forms, none more important than Victor Hugo`s novel published in English as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;.  \n \n Before the flames, time and weather were the cathedrals determined and powerful enemies.  Desperately needed restoration work was already \n \n underway.  Now saving Notre Dame has become a critical goal for all of France.  In a place famed for beautiful, old buildings one stood above all \n \n others as an icon of the nation`s story and the French people are not ready to let it go. Phil Black, CNN, London.\n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  The next U.S. presidential election is more than a year and a half away so why would we address it this far out?  Because 20 candidates \n \n already have.  U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has filed his reelection paperwork.  He did it the day he was sworn into the presidency.  \n \n In recent months, one Republican and 18 Democrats have officially announced they`re challenging President Trump for the job and there are several other \n \n Democrats who are thinking about joining the race.  This all culminates in the presidential election on November 3rd, 2020 and along the way voters, \n \n events, travel and a lot of money all come into play.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You want to run for president.  Being president makes you the single most powerful person, man or woman, in the world but it`s \n \n also a multiyear commitment that forces you to give up your personal life and any since of privacy.  And then about half the country`s going to hate \n \n you no matter what you do.  The Constitution has only three requirements, natural born citizen, at least 35 years old, 14 years residing in the \n \n United States but there`s so much more to it.  First, there`s the primary process.  Since only Republicans or Democrats are seen as serious \n \n candidates you have to choose a party and get popular in that party.\n \nAn inspirational biography helps.  Maybe some years as governor or Senator, although even a few mayors think they`re ready this year and a Congressman \n \n who lost a Senate race.  Might now matter since the current president had zero government experience when he ran.  You spend nearly a year bouncing \n \n back and forth from Iowa to New Hampshire to South Carolina to Nevada.  If you`re not with voters, you`re raising money and raising money and raising \n \n money.  It takes millions to mount a serious bid and you can only raise $2,700 per donor for the primary and $2,700 per donor for the general \n \n election.  If you get that far. \n \nHillary Clinton raised and spent almost $1 billion losing to Donald Trump.  He raised much less.  The primaries are expensive too.  Bernie Sanders \n \n spent $222 million on his 2016 primary loss.  Why is it so expensive?  You`ve got to have an army of staffers and volunteers.  You have to buy TV \n \n ads, internet ads.  In the general election, you`re going to spend every waking hour in Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, maybe Ohio, Colorado.  \n \nIf you want to win, you should probably visit Wisconsin.  There are debates and town halls and interview after interview after interview.  And then if \n \n you win, you get to be president.  It means you live above the office.  You get to try to work with Congress to get something done.  Oh, and you`re \n \n going to have to start running for reelection on day one.   \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.

I`m Carl Azuz, explaining events from around the world.  Thank you for taking 10 \n \n minutes to watch.  A massive storm system welled up last week in the United States.  A nation that consistently has the most violent weather in the \n \n world.  When we put this show together, there were 90 million people, more than a quarter of the entire U.S. population who were under the threat of \n \n destructive weather.  In Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, at least five people were killed as the system swept across the south on Saturday and \n \n Sunday.  \n \nA tornado was spotted in southeast Alabama Sunday morning and that wasn`t the only threat.  A CNN meteorologist said the storms also carried damaging \n \n winds and hail.  The National Weather Service warned people in the path that torrential rains could cause flash flooding in some areas.  Monroe \n \n County, in northeast Mississippi, was hit particularly hard according to its sheriff.  He said the area was a mess after homes, businesses and a \n \n fire station were destroyed.  \n \nThere was also a lot of flooding there and two states east in Georgia, tee times were scheduled earlier for The Masters golf tournament on Sunday \n \n because heavy storms were expected to pass through later that night.  In fact, a tornado watch was issued for the city of Augusta, as well as parts \n \n of South Carolina Sunday night.  Knowing the difference between a watch and a warning can help you know what action you should take.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When severe weather strikes, one of the most common questions we get, what`s the difference between a watch and a warning?  \n \n Well just for comparison sake let`s take this stoplight, green light, yellow light, red light.  Sometimes the National Weather Service will issue \n \n a hazardous weather outlook, an advisory, treat this as a green light.  Know that the possibility that rough weather is there but go about your day \n \n as you would just stay alert.  But as conditions tend to ripen, we may see a tornado watch issued by the National Weather Service. \n \nUse this with more caution.  This means conditions are favorable for tornado development and so you need to know what you should do in case a \n \n tornado strikes.  That`s where the warning comes in.  If the radar has indicated a tornado or someone has spotted a tornado in progress, that`s \n \n when the tornado warning is issued and you should get to your safe place immediately.  Stop what you`re doing and seek shelter.  \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Where would you most likely find regolith?  Off Iceland`s coast, In Earth`s core, On the moon or On Jupiter`s surface.  \n \n Regolith is a loose rocky covering of a planet`s surface.  Scientists say Jupiter has no firm surface so the answer here is the moon. \n \nIt launched into space in February and circled the earth several times before being sling shotted away.  It traveled a total of four million miles \n \n and finally reached the moon but not in the way Israeli scientists hoped it would.  Their unmanned privately funded spacecraft was supposed to make a \n \n soft controlled landing there but communication was lost when it was about 500 feet away from the moon`s surface, and it was traveling toward it at \n \n 310 miles per hour.  So, well, boom.  If it had been successful, this would have been the first time a private organization made a controlled landing \n \n with the smallest budget.  Still the team and their nation`s leader have suggested this isn`t the end. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nMICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There were high hopes and high drama and in the end high disappointment for the people behind this ambitious \n \n privately funded $100 million project.  From the beginning, it was the case of the little guy shooting for the moon or more precisely a soft landing on \n \n the moon and they nearly made it with their spacecraft Beresheet which means Genesis.  There was a crowd that included the Prime Minister Benjamin \n \n Netanyahu watching on but the team lost contact with the spacecraft in the last moments before the planned touchdown.  \n \nApparently engine problems and then the descent became uncontrollable and it crashed.  In a moment of classic understatement, one of the project \n \n managers saying, I`m sorry to say but our spacecraft did not make it in one piece to the moon.  If they had, Israel would have been just the fourth \n \n country to soft land on the moon after the old Soviet Union, the U.S. and China.  Still though, a major achievement for an upstart group that began \n \n eight years ago as part of a Google competition.\n \n They didn`t make the deadline for that competition but decided to keep going with private funding and a lot of good old chutzpah and they came oh \n \n so close to success.  Still became only the seventh country to get to the moon if not successfully land on it.  A lot of pride in Israel in this \n \n project.  Plenty of people watching live including school kids at the president`s home and those behind the project not letting the less than \n \n soft landing put them off.  For its part SpaceIL says quote, &quot;Don`t stop believing.  We will continue to work hard.&quot;  And then the Prime Minister \n \n Netanyahu saying quote, &quot; We will try again.  Next time it will be better.&quot;  A sign perhaps of government involvement going forward quote, &quot;I`m \n \n seriously considering investing now in the space program.&quot;  Michael Holmes, CNN, Jerusalem. \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  Space investors from around the world will probably have a new option for getting their satellites into orbit.  It`s called Stratolaunch \n \n and its considered to be a mega jet.  Six engines, two cockpits though only one is used to fly it.  Its wing span is 385 feet which is wider than an \n \n American football field is long.  This plane is longer, wider and heavier than the H-4 Hercules, also known as the Spruce Goose.  And the \n \n Stratolaunch made history Saturday morning when it lifted off the ground, got up to speeds of 173 miles per hour and climbed 15,000 feet into the \n \n sky. \n \nBut you and I aren`t going to fly it as passengers.  This thing`s designed to carry rockets loaded with satellites so they can be launched from an \n \n altitude of 35,000 feet into orbit.  That can save money over ground based launches.  Stratolaunch was funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen who \n \n died last October.  It does have competitions from other companies and it has a series of test flights and certifications to go through before it can \n \n actually start working. \n \nThere are an estimated 1.3 million people in America who are classified as unaccompanied youths.  One of them lost his mother when he was 12.  His \n \n father was incarcerated when he was 13 and he didn`t have anywhere to live.  That`s a problem that Vicki Sokolik has been working to solve since 2007 \n \n when she founded Starting Right Now.  It`s an organization that`s helped more than 200 young people in Tampa Florida. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nVICKI SOKOLIK:  A homeless, unaccompanied youth is about 15 to 19 years old who is not with their parents or guardian and not eligible for foster care \n \n because they weren`t taken from their home but rather they made the decision to leave their dangerous situation.  Most people don`t even know \n \n these kids exist.  There`s a lot of shame that goes with being a homeless unaccompanied youth.  They hide what`s actually going on with them and so \n \n they really become this very invisible population.\n \nHello.  Hello.  Hello.  \n \nWe have helped 200 unaccompanied homeless youth.  Our kids were just dealt bad hands and we help them reshuffle their deck.  \n \nDo you want a pescate?  No.  Just banana bread? \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  \n \nSOKOLIK:  We offer safe and stable housing, academic support, a reliable mentor in their life and all with the goal of getting each student to reach \n \n their own full potential.  We went to great lengths to build houses to make them really feel like homes.  A lot of times, it`s a first time they \n \n actually have a bed that they can call their own.  We look at every single student as an individual person.  If a student needs extreme academic \n \n support?  That`s what we`re going to focus on.  If a student needs extreme therapy?  That`s what we`re going to focus on and then we help them plan \n \n their future. \n \nOK.  So you`re still planning on going to SPC. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  \n \nSOKOLIK:  97 percent of our kids graduate high school and go on to their next goal.  The transformation of these kids is monumental.  They come in \n \n so broken.  They cannot trust and I`m just one person telling them I`m going to help them.  They become softer.

In its new $1.3 \n \n billion shopping complex, Changi has added an indoor forest complete with an indoor waterfall.  Its more than 130 feet high making it the tallest \n \n indoor waterfall on the planet and what better place to put it than the airport that`s been ranked the best in the world.\n \nWho needs a runway when you can have a &quot;spillway&quot;?
