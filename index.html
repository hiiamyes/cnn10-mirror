CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  With the fire out in Notre Dame, French officials and historians are combing through the cathedral to take stock of 
 
 what`s left.  There was a lot saved.  The two towers and facade at the front, what many people envision when they think of Notre Dame, they`re 
 
 still standing.  A Paris city hall spokesperson says the cathedrals most significant treasures were saved including what Notre Dame calls its most 
 
 precious and venerated relic.  A crown of thorns which many believe is the crown of thorns that was placed on the head of Jesus Christ.
 
The chaplain of the Paris fire service is being called a hero for rescuing that and other artifacts and the cathedrals great organ is safe.  Scores of 
 
 the relics that survived were taken to the Louvre Museum, what was lost the cathedral`s spire, large parts of its roof and it`s ancient vaulted 
 
 ceiling.  The central part of the building was damaged.  The Paris Fire Brigade says it`s not known yet what caused the fire.  A French government 
 
 spokesman says it could be months before the full scope of the damage is known and a restoration expert expects it will take 10 to 15 years to fully 
 
 rebuild Notre Dame. 
 
The Vatican has offered its technical expertise in restoring the medieval catholic church and as far as funding goes, French philanthropists and 
 
 businesses have pledged more than $700 million in donations to restore the cathedral.  That gives you one sense about what Notre Dame means to France.  
 
 Here`s another.  Victor Hugo`s novel, &amp;quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&amp;quot; became the best selling book on Amazon France shortly after the fire took place.  
 
 A different edition of the same novel was the second best selling book, for a third sense of the building`s significance here`s CNN`s Phil Black. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  How do you measure the profound value of one old building to a nation or to the world?  Perhaps when people stop in 
 
 the street to weep and pray because of its partial destruction, when the French president openly shares that grief. 
 
FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON:  (untranslated)
 
BLACK:  And efforts to save it are broadcast everywhere.  Notre Dame is among the most famous of famous buildings, 13 million people visit it every 
 
 year.  Countless more stand before it, tilt their heads up and gaze at the extraordinary vertical scale. The vast rose windows and the many ornate 
 
 sculptures guarding its exterior.  Gargoyles, saints and angels, all the features that make it a masterpiece of the Gothic style but few visitors 
 
 saw this. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (untranslated)
 
BLACK:  A 2018 special broadcast by local network France Deux (ph) showed these images, the centuries old woodwork supporting the roof.  There`s so 
 
 much oak here its known as the forest of Notre Dame.  The same timber structures that would just a few months later feed a fire that threatened 
 
 to destroy the whole cathedral.  Notre Dame, Our Lady of Paris has stood since the 1200s`.  A building in constant evolution as artists and 
 
 craftsmen altered and repaired the structure and its decorations.  The towering timber spire now a loss to the flames was added in the 1800s`.  
 
Often a symbol and reflection of French political power, the cathedral was vandalized through the French Revolution while Napoleon Bonaparte used it 
 
 to reinstate monarchic rule with his coronation as Emperor.  Later, French Republican leaders, the nations presidents were honored here too.  This 
 
 service was for military hero and statesman Charles de Gaulle.  Notre Dame survived the violence and the occupation of war.  More recently terrorist 
 
 attacks in Paris saw it become a focus for the nations grief. 
 
An inspiration for artists across many art forms, none more important than Victor Hugo`s novel published in English as &amp;quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&amp;quot;.  
 
 Before the flames, time and weather were the cathedrals determined and powerful enemies.  Desperately needed restoration work was already 
 
 underway.  Now saving Notre Dame has become a critical goal for all of France.  In a place famed for beautiful, old buildings one stood above all 
 
 others as an icon of the nation`s story and the French people are not ready to let it go. Phil Black, CNN, London.

AZUZ:  The next U.S. presidential election is more than a year and a half away so why would we address it this far out?  Because 20 candidates 
 
 already have.  U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has filed his reelection paperwork.  He did it the day he was sworn into the presidency.  
 
 In recent months, one Republican and 18 Democrats have officially announced they`re challenging President Trump for the job and there are several other 
 
 Democrats who are thinking about joining the race.  This all culminates in the presidential election on November 3rd, 2020 and along the way voters, 
 
 events, travel and a lot of money all come into play.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You want to run for president.  Being president makes you the single most powerful person, man or woman, in the world but it`s 
 
 also a multiyear commitment that forces you to give up your personal life and any since of privacy.  And then about half the country`s going to hate 
 
 you no matter what you do.  The Constitution has only three requirements, natural born citizen, at least 35 years old, 14 years residing in the 
 
 United States but there`s so much more to it.  First, there`s the primary process.  Since only Republicans or Democrats are seen as serious 
 
 candidates you have to choose a party and get popular in that party.
 
An inspirational biography helps.  Maybe some years as governor or Senator, although even a few mayors think they`re ready this year and a Congressman 
 
 who lost a Senate race.  Might now matter since the current president had zero government experience when he ran.  You spend nearly a year bouncing 
 
 back and forth from Iowa to New Hampshire to South Carolina to Nevada.  If you`re not with voters, you`re raising money and raising money and raising 
 
 money.  It takes millions to mount a serious bid and you can only raise $2,700 per donor for the primary and $2,700 per donor for the general 
 
 election.  If you get that far. 
 
Hillary Clinton raised and spent almost $1 billion losing to Donald Trump.  He raised much less.  The primaries are expensive too.  Bernie Sanders 
 
 spent $222 million on his 2016 primary loss.  Why is it so expensive?  You`ve got to have an army of staffers and volunteers.  You have to buy TV 
 
 ads, internet ads.  In the general election, you`re going to spend every waking hour in Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, maybe Ohio, Colorado.  
 
If you want to win, you should probably visit Wisconsin.  There are debates and town halls and interview after interview after interview.  And then if 
 
 you win, you get to be president.  It means you live above the office.  You get to try to work with Congress to get something done.  Oh, and you`re 
 
 going to have to start running for reelection on day one.

AZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Before the U.S. Air Force became an independent branch of the military, under which branch was it organized?  Army, Navy, 
 
 Coast Guard, or Marines Corps.  The U.S. Air Force started as the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army`s Signal Corps.

AZUZ:  Dubai United Arab Emirates is a desert so there`s not much rain but when there is and its accompanied by thunder, the Birds Khalifa the world`s 
 
 tallest building becomes a lightening rod.  The massive jolts of electricity were diverted down to earth.  Nobody was hurt but plenty of 
 
 people shared video and pictures including Dubai`s Crown Prince.  
 
It`s not just &amp;quot;lightful&amp;quot;.  It`s &amp;quot;delightful&amp;quot;.  An illuminating jolt that brings both &amp;quot;felicity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;electricity&amp;quot;.   It &amp;quot;sparks&amp;quot; conversation and 
 
 concern.  It draws both a crowd and a &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot;.   It`s a &amp;quot;power trip&amp;quot; that trips &amp;quot;power transforming transformers&amp;quot; and bring a &amp;quot;shock&amp;quot; to all who see 
 
 it.  I`m Carl Azuz, &amp;quot;lighting&amp;quot; up another edition of CNN 10.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  A new week of CNN 10 starts right now.  I`m Carl Azuz, explaining events from around the world.  Thank you for taking 10 
 
 minutes to watch.  A massive storm system welled up last week in the United States.  A nation that consistently has the most violent weather in the 
 
 world.  When we put this show together, there were 90 million people, more than a quarter of the entire U.S. population who were under the threat of 
 
 destructive weather.  In Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, at least five people were killed as the system swept across the south on Saturday and 
 
 Sunday.  
 
A tornado was spotted in southeast Alabama Sunday morning and that wasn`t the only threat.  A CNN meteorologist said the storms also carried damaging 
 
 winds and hail.  The National Weather Service warned people in the path that torrential rains could cause flash flooding in some areas.  Monroe 
 
 County, in northeast Mississippi, was hit particularly hard according to its sheriff.  He said the area was a mess after homes, businesses and a 
 
 fire station were destroyed.  
 
There was also a lot of flooding there and two states east in Georgia, tee times were scheduled earlier for The Masters golf tournament on Sunday 
 
 because heavy storms were expected to pass through later that night.  In fact, a tornado watch was issued for the city of Augusta, as well as parts 
 
 of South Carolina Sunday night.  Knowing the difference between a watch and a warning can help you know what action you should take.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When severe weather strikes, one of the most common questions we get, what`s the difference between a watch and a warning?  
 
 Well just for comparison sake let`s take this stoplight, green light, yellow light, red light.  Sometimes the National Weather Service will issue 
 
 a hazardous weather outlook, an advisory, treat this as a green light.  Know that the possibility that rough weather is there but go about your day 
 
 as you would just stay alert.  But as conditions tend to ripen, we may see a tornado watch issued by the National Weather Service. 
 
Use this with more caution.  This means conditions are favorable for tornado development and so you need to know what you should do in case a 
 
 tornado strikes.  That`s where the warning comes in.  If the radar has indicated a tornado or someone has spotted a tornado in progress, that`s 
 
 when the tornado warning is issued and you should get to your safe place immediately.  Stop what you`re doing and seek shelter.

AZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Where would you most likely find regolith?  Off Iceland`s coast, In Earth`s core, On the moon or On Jupiter`s surface.  
 
 Regolith is a loose rocky covering of a planet`s surface.  Scientists say Jupiter has no firm surface so the answer here is the moon. 
 
It launched into space in February and circled the earth several times before being sling shotted away.  It traveled a total of four million miles 
 
 and finally reached the moon but not in the way Israeli scientists hoped it would.  Their unmanned privately funded spacecraft was supposed to make a 
 
 soft controlled landing there but communication was lost when it was about 500 feet away from the moon`s surface, and it was traveling toward it at 
 
 310 miles per hour.  So, well, boom.  If it had been successful, this would have been the first time a private organization made a controlled landing 
 
 with the smallest budget.  Still the team and their nation`s leader have suggested this isn`t the end. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There were high hopes and high drama and in the end high disappointment for the people behind this ambitious 
 
 privately funded $100 million project.  From the beginning, it was the case of the little guy shooting for the moon or more precisely a soft landing on 
 
 the moon and they nearly made it with their spacecraft Beresheet which means Genesis.  There was a crowd that included the Prime Minister Benjamin 
 
 Netanyahu watching on but the team lost contact with the spacecraft in the last moments before the planned touchdown.  
 
Apparently engine problems and then the descent became uncontrollable and it crashed.  In a moment of classic understatement, one of the project 
 
 managers saying, I`m sorry to say but our spacecraft did not make it in one piece to the moon.  If they had, Israel would have been just the fourth 
 
 country to soft land on the moon after the old Soviet Union, the U.S. and China.  Still though, a major achievement for an upstart group that began 
 
 eight years ago as part of a Google competition.
 
 They didn`t make the deadline for that competition but decided to keep going with private funding and a lot of good old chutzpah and they came oh 
 
 so close to success.  Still became only the seventh country to get to the moon if not successfully land on it.  A lot of pride in Israel in this 
 
 project.  Plenty of people watching live including school kids at the president`s home and those behind the project not letting the less than 
 
 soft landing put them off.  For its part SpaceIL says quote, &amp;quot;Don`t stop believing.  We will continue to work hard.&amp;quot;  And then the Prime Minister 
 
 Netanyahu saying quote, &amp;quot; We will try again.  Next time it will be better.&amp;quot;  A sign perhaps of government involvement going forward quote, &amp;quot;I`m 
 
 seriously considering investing now in the space program.&amp;quot;  Michael Holmes, CNN, Jerusalem.

AZUZ:  Space investors from around the world will probably have a new option for getting their satellites into orbit.  It`s called Stratolaunch 
 
 and its considered to be a mega jet.  Six engines, two cockpits though only one is used to fly it.  Its wing span is 385 feet which is wider than an 
 
 American football field is long.  This plane is longer, wider and heavier than the H-4 Hercules, also known as the Spruce Goose.  And the 
 
 Stratolaunch made history Saturday morning when it lifted off the ground, got up to speeds of 173 miles per hour and climbed 15,000 feet into the 
 
 sky. 
 
But you and I aren`t going to fly it as passengers.  This thing`s designed to carry rockets loaded with satellites so they can be launched from an 
 
 altitude of 35,000 feet into orbit.  That can save money over ground based launches.  Stratolaunch was funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen who 
 
 died last October.  It does have competitions from other companies and it has a series of test flights and certifications to go through before it can 
 
 actually start working. 
 
There are an estimated 1.3 million people in America who are classified as unaccompanied youths.  One of them lost his mother when he was 12.  His 
 
 father was incarcerated when he was 13 and he didn`t have anywhere to live.  That`s a problem that Vicki Sokolik has been working to solve since 2007 
 
 when she founded Starting Right Now.  It`s an organization that`s helped more than 200 young people in Tampa Florida. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VICKI SOKOLIK:  A homeless, unaccompanied youth is about 15 to 19 years old who is not with their parents or guardian and not eligible for foster care 
 
 because they weren`t taken from their home but rather they made the decision to leave their dangerous situation.  Most people don`t even know 
 
 these kids exist.  There`s a lot of shame that goes with being a homeless unaccompanied youth.  They hide what`s actually going on with them and so 
 
 they really become this very invisible population.
 
Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  
 
We have helped 200 unaccompanied homeless youth.  Our kids were just dealt bad hands and we help them reshuffle their deck.  
 
Do you want a pescate?  No.  Just banana bread? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  
 
SOKOLIK:  We offer safe and stable housing, academic support, a reliable mentor in their life and all with the goal of getting each student to reach 
 
 their own full potential.  We went to great lengths to build houses to make them really feel like homes.  A lot of times, it`s a first time they 
 
 actually have a bed that they can call their own.  We look at every single student as an individual person.  If a student needs extreme academic 
 
 support?  That`s what we`re going to focus on.  If a student needs extreme therapy?  That`s what we`re going to focus on and then we help them plan 
 
 their future. 
 
OK.  So you`re still planning on going to SPC. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  
 
SOKOLIK:  97 percent of our kids graduate high school and go on to their next goal.  The transformation of these kids is monumental.  They come in 
 
 so broken.  They cannot trust and I`m just one person telling them I`m going to help them.  They become softer.  It`s just great that they can be 
 
 happy and they`re be able to be kids again.  These are kids who have been told they don`t matter and their voice does matter.

AZUZ:  Airports and waterfalls seem like two things that don`t really go together but they do at Singapore`s Changi Airport.  In its new $1.3 
 
 billion shopping complex, Changi has added an indoor forest complete with an indoor waterfall.  Its more than 130 feet high making it the tallest 
 
 indoor waterfall on the planet and what better place to put it than the airport that`s been ranked the best in the world.
 
Who needs a runway when you can have a &amp;quot;spillway&amp;quot;?  Who needs a layover when you can have a &amp;quot;spray over&amp;quot;?  In the &amp;quot;concourse&amp;quot; of travel, when 
 
 people get &amp;quot;hangered&amp;quot; up by delays that seem &amp;quot;interminable&amp;quot; it`s great to have a tower of water if the tower of control gets backed up.  Maybe Changi 
 
 will become a destination of its own for some folks who just don`t want to &amp;quot;departure&amp;quot;.  This is your captain Carl Azuz landing another edition of 
 
 CNN.
