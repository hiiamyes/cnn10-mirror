CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 HOST:  Welcome to everyone watching around the world.  I`m Carl Azuz for CNN 10.  This date of this show is May 2, 2019, which 
 
 means we`re almost exactly a year and a half from the next U.S. presidential election and 21 people have already declared their candidacy 
 
 for president, in addition to the incumbent leader himself.  
 
President Donald Trump filed his reelection paperwork, just hours after he was inaugurated, on January 20, 2017.  One candidate, a former governor of 
 
 Massachusetts, has said he`ll challenge President Trump for the republican nomination.  And as far as democrats go, there are 20, a record number of 
 
 them who`ve officially announced their candidacy.  
 
They include a former U.S. vice president, a number of senators and representatives, some mayors, an author, a former cabinet official.  But 
 
 why are these campaigns seemingly in full-swing when we`re still more than eight months away from even the first primaries and caucuses that help 
 
 determine the party nominees?  Money is one reason.  
 
Fundraising is a critical part of any presidential run, and announcing early helps candidates start getting the donations that`ll help fuel that 
 
 run.  Another reason, getting their name out there.  Candidates need voters to be familiar with them, so this is a chance for presidential hopefuls to 
 
 make connections well ahead of the elections.
 
Also, debate season is just around the corner.  It kicks off at the beginning of summer and runs through next spring.  So the candidates are 
 
 working to qualify so they can get their faces and their messages on the national stage.  
 
Ten Second Trivia.  Who is the chief justice of the United States: John Roberts, Mike Pompeo, William Barr or Neil Gorsuch?  The chief justice, 
 
 who`s also the chief judge of the U.S. Supreme Court is John Roberts.  
 
That`s a question from the civics part of the U.S. Naturalization Test, the test that someone born outside the United States takes to become a citizen.  
 
 The exam has a total of 100 questions, but only 10 of those are asked to people applying for U.S. citizenship, and they have to get at least six of 
 
 the answers right.  
 
A new law was just passed in the State of Indiana that requires all high school students there to take the Naturalization Test as part of their 
 
 civics studies.  They don`t have to pass the test to graduate.  They just have to take it.  Those who support the law say they`re concerned that many 
 
 American high school students wouldn`t be able to pass the test. 
 
So they`re hoping that requiring them to take it will help solve that.  Those who oppose the law say it`s not necessary since students are already 
 
 learning this information through their civics, history and social studies classes.  The law`s set to take effect next school year.  Several other 
 
 states have a similar requirement in place.  
 
Today, we decided to test you knowledge with a few more questions from the Naturalization Test.  First, who is known as the father of our country: 
 
 George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, or Thomas Jefferson?  The answer: America`s first president, George Washington.
 
Next, what are the first words of the U.S. Constitution? We hold these truths, four score and seven years ago, Congress shall make no law, or we 
 
 the people?  The answer: We the people.  Finally, how many U.S. senators are there: 50, 100, 435, or 438?  The answer: 100.  Two senators for every 
 
 state.
 
Forty years after the launch of 1G, meaning first-generation wireless technology, we`re standing on the threshold of 5G.  It`s going to come at a 
 
 cost.  Hundreds of billions of dollars are needed to develop 5G.  There`re currently around 200,000 cell towers around America, dedicated to 4G.  
 
Experts estimate it`ll take at least 300,000 more to manage the fifth- generation.  There`re security concerns, and there`s also the question, what do we do when our computers and smart phones just don`t work properly?  
 
 But if everything does -

SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  5G isn`t just going to change your mobile internet speed.  It`s going to touch nearly everything around you.  Right, 
 
 Sophia?  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It will allow everything to be connected.  I`m getting excited just thinking about it.
 
BURKE:  Let`s take some everyday scenarios.  You leave work, you get in your car, go home, eat dinner, take that shower, and go to bed.  Well, 5G 
 
 is going to change all of that.  Let`s start with the drive.  Tell me how 5G is going to change that commute home, and this bad boy.
 
CHRISTOPH GROTE, SVP ELECTRONICS, BMW GROUP:  This car`s permanently surveying the road around and sending relevant bits of information up to 
 
 the cloud, generating a true real-time map that, in turn, is pushed down to all the other cars.  Autonomous driving is not the capability of a car.  
 
 It`s really about swarm intelligence, and that`s why 5G is so crucial.
 
LAILA WORRELL, CEO, ALTRAN NORTH AMERICA:  The real magic of 5G is in the amount of data that can be transmitted through the increased capacity, the 
 
 increased bandwidth.  That really enables a whole range of applications that currently aren`t possible.
 
BURKE:  Why in the world would you need to have data connected beehive, David?
 
DAVID HOUGHTON, GENERAL MANAGER, ASSET TRACKING SOLUTIONS, NIMBLELINK:  Beehives, as you know, are valuable, and as such, they`re in demand.  And 
 
 so, hivekeepers need to protect them.  So they use asset trackers to essentially monitor the health of the hive.  Checking into the cloud once a 
 
 day, which is the industry metric for an asset tracker, this device will last 14 years.
 
BURKE:  So really, the lesson here is 5G isn`t just about speed.  It is also about power.  On one end of the spectrum, using a ton of power.  On 
 
 the other end of the spectrum, using as little power as possible to get the longest lifespan possible.
 
WORRELL:  5G`s going to have a massive impact on people`s lives.  It`ll happen over time as the technology is deployed, and its use cases are 
 
 developed.  But we`re going to see a really big advance in the quality of life that 5G can deliver for individuals.  
 
BURKE:  But all that isn`t enough for some people with 5G rolling out others are already focused on 6G -- 6G, really?
 
ARI POUTTU, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF OULU:  Well yes, you can have smart services with (inaudible) electronics in them -- smart glasses so you can 
 
 have your device everywhere.  
 
BURKE:  When do you think that 6G will roll out?  
 
POUTTU:  Standardization activities are expected to start in 2028, so a couple of years after that -- 2030. 
 
BURKE:  2030.  
 
POUTTU:  Yes.  
 
BURKE:  So 2019 is the year of 5G, 2030 6G.  See you then.

AZUZ:  For 10 out of 10 Graham and Steve (ph) those are the names of two of the newest traffic reporters in the city of London.  Yeah, this job is for 
 
 the birds.  According to Transport for London, these seagulls decided to perch in front of the traffic camera at, &amp;quot;beak times,&amp;quot; giving an extra 
 
 bird`s eye view of conditions.  This happened over the course of a couple of days and of course it went viral thanks to the internets.  
 
Should have named them Jonathan and Livingston.  It takes a lot of gull to wing a photobomb like that, but there are worse ways to spend (inaudible) 
 
 day, even for the most gullible.
 
And who wouldn`t want to turn fishing (ph) for the chance to catch fame on camera?  It`s no red herring and the outcome was simply &amp;quot;ungullivable.&amp;quot;  
 
 I`m Carl Azuz for CNN10.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 HOST:  Welcome to CNN 10, where people (ph) in Venezuela is the first story we`re explaining this Wednesday.  I`m Carl Azuz at the 
 
 CNN Center.  On April 30, conflicting reports were coming out about what was happening in the South American country.  
 
During a protest in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, Juan Guaido, the opposition leader, who in January, declared himself the new president of 
 
 Venezuela.  He said, quote, &amp;quot;Operation Freedom has begun.  We`re going to stand here together, asking and demanding the military to join.&amp;quot;  
 
CNN reporters called this an escalation of Guaido`s efforts to remove Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, from power.  What we don`t know is 
 
 whether this amounts to an attempted military coup, when the armed forces take action to change a nation`s government.  Guaido`s ambassador in 
 
 Washington says it`s not a military coup.  
 
He called it a constitutional process led by the Venezuelan people, and said there`d be more events in the hours and days to come.  A Venezuelan 
 
 government official also said it wasn`t a military coup.  But he told the Reuters news agency that it was another chapter in an attempted civilian 
 
 coup led by Venezuela`s opposition party and supported by the U.S.
 
So the question here is, have members of Venezuela`s military, which have largely supported President Maduro, now join forces with the opposition 
 
 protestors who want Maduro out of power.  At the time we produced this show, we didn`t have a clear answer on that.  We`ll keep you updated on 
 
 what happens in the troubled South American nation.  
 
Next story.  Earlier this month, the island nation of Philippines protested to China, because hundreds of Chinese boats were sailing near an island 
 
 administered by the Philippines.  But this particular place is also in the Spratly`s Chain, a disputed area that includes manmade islands that China 
 
 has built up in recent years.
 
Despite the dispute, the president of the Philippines has strengthened his country`s relationship with China, and that country`s investments in the 
 
 Philippines have caused concerns for some people there and aboard.

MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It was U.S. military power in the heart of the Philippines.  For decades, Clark Air Base was the largest American base 
 
 outside the U.S.  Veterans Anthony Grimm and John Gilbert remember it well.
 
ANTHONY GRIMM, U.S. VETERAN:  It was a little American.  It really was.
 
RIVERS:  The town is still called Clark, still has a VFW post, but the base is a memory.  The Americans left in 1991.  
 
JOHN GILBERT, U.S. VIETNAM:  Well, after Vietnam, we no longer needed those bases.  They were not a critical asset.
 
RIVERS:  So the old base sat idle for years, but not anymore.
 
VINCE DIZON, BASES CONVERSION AND DEVELOPMENT:  So this is going to be a major hub, not just for the country but in the entire region.  
 
RIVERS:  It`ll cover more area than Manhattan - skyscrapers, a new airport, residential, billions of dollars of investment.  And who`s helping build 
 
 it?  You are seeing more of a Chinese influence here.
 
GILBERT:  Oh, sure.
 
GRIMM:  Oh, yes.
 
GILBERT:  A lot of - a lot of projects.
 
RIVERS:  Chinese money has poured into the Philippines recently, joining other firms already here.  This company, owned by Chinese government, is 
 
 building a road.  A half a mile away, the steel going up isn`t from Pittsburgh.  
 
The fact that I`m surrounded by Chinese steel and that China is one of the biggest country investors in this new city is remarkable, given the state 
 
 of relations between the Philippines and China, just a few years ago. 
 
China-Filipino (ph) relations hit rock-bottom in mid-2016, after Manila took Beijing to international court over artificial islands China has built 
 
 and militarized, not far form the Filipino coast.  About that time though, came a new president, Rodrigo Duterte.
 
RODRIGO DUTERTE, PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES:  I announce my separation from the United States.
 
(APPLAUSE)
 
RIVERS:  Duterte said that in Beijing, and soon cozied up to China.  China has since pledged tens of billions of dollars to projects in the 
 
 Philippines, whose supports call healthy, necessary loans.  
 
DIZON:  The sheer scale that China brings is something that not a lot of countries can bring to any economy.  
 
RIVERS:  But some see that spending as dangerous.  Should anything go wrong with repayments, Manila could be beholden to Beijing.  
 
ANTONIO TRILLANES, SENATOR OF THE PHILIPPINES:  It`s the ultimate symbol of the eventual subjugation of the Philippines towards China.  
 
RIVERS:  China has doled out hundreds of billions in similar loans to developing countries across Asia and Africa, and the U.S. has warned of 
 
 debt-trap diplomacy.  Beijing recently took a 99-year lease on a key port in Sri Lanka, after the government there defaulted on Chinese loans used to 
 
 build it.
 
The Duterte administration argues the Philippines is different and faces no such threat.  Plus, the U.S. still has a defense treaty with Manila.  But 
 
 in this zero-sum game for influence, when America gives room, China will try to fill that void.

AZUZ:  Ten  second trivia. Which of these African nations borders both Lake Victoria and the Indian Ocean?  Somalia, Uganda, Ethiopia, or Kenya?  The 
 
 only one of these countries that borders both of these bodies of water is Kenya.
 
According to the CIA world fact book, the back bone of Kenya`s economy is agriculture. It accounts for about a third of the nation`s gross domestic 
 
 product.  But tourism also factors in.  And when a married couple from the U.S. state of Nevada recently traveled to Kenya, they wanted something a 
 
 little bit off the beaten path of safaris and big game hunting.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I`m Tracy Chidum (ph).
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And I`m Mark Macintyre (ph).
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We are from Las Vegas and we came to Kenya to celebrate my 50th birthday.  This guy said I could go anywhere in the world 
 
 and I picked Kenya.
 
JOHN ELIAS, CHAIRMAN, OL LENTILLE TRUST &amp;amp; CEO, REGENESIS LIMITED:  We`re within the Ol Lentille conservatory, which is about 40,000 acres of 
 
 community land and three times the size of Manhattan.
 
(CROSSTALK)
 
Most of our guests are thoughtful intelligent people.  And thoughtful intelligent people just love to solve problems.  So we show them problems 
 
 and there response to that is how can I help.  We build schools, we employ teachers, we built a hospital. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  I wanted to make a donation to the kids for school supplies.  I didn`t want to come to Kenya for safari.  I 
 
 wanted to come to Kenya for the people.  I wanted to learn about the culture because that`s not what people do.  And I love going the opposite 
 
 direction. 
 
EZEKIAL KAPARSIP, HEAD TEACHER, NKILORITI SCHOOL:  The program we have with these students, they come from far.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How far are they traveling to get there? KAPARSIP:  Some either go as far as 10 kilometers, 5 kilometers.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So that`s you all are working for now.  You want some place where -- so they don`t have to walk so far to go to school?
 
KAPARSIP: Yes.
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I remember when I went to Tanzania (ph) I was constantly asked where was I from.  And I would say, I`m sorry, what.  What 
 
 part of Africa are you from.  And that`s how this all got started because I couldn`t answer that question.
 
And so I did one of those DNA test, you know, so I could figure out which countries that I was from because apparently I had to be from somewhere.  
 
 When we got the results, I was from everywhere. So it`s important for me to come back because now when I get asked the question where are you from, I 
 
 can say I am from here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here with great pride.
 
TIMOTHY OLE MOSIANY, OPERATIONS MANAGER, SANCTUARY AT OL LENTILLE:  There are only two different families in the village and normally they can leave 
 
 as one family and one village or friends together. 
 
We try to encourage our guest to have fun while doing good.  At the same time they end up enjoying the place and wanting to be part of the project 
 
 and be part of the community that they have come to visit.

AZUZ:  Well this is unlikely, at Ohio`s Walnut Hills High School, 17 students recently got a perfect score on the ACT.  A college admissions 
 
 test.  And the school says 23 more seniors were only one point away from perfect score.  
 
So what.  Well according to the administrators of the test, our of the roughly 2 million students who take it every year, only 1/10 of 1 percent 
 
 of them get a perfect score.  So to have 17 perfect scores at one high school is nothing short of ACTerrific.  They became number one with a 
 
 number two pencil.  
 
They set a new standardized.  The teachers had a multiple choice of students to congratulate.  Just don`t tell a competing exam they had a 
 
 scholastic aptitude for it.  That might test some nerves.  I`m picking C and A for Carl Azuz on CNN.

CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR:  On this last day of April, we thank you for taking 10 for CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz, at the CNN Center.  Our first story, in a 
 
 part of Africa that`s still reeling from a cyclone that made landfall in March, government officials are now getting an idea of the destruction by a 
 
 second major storm.  
 
This one was named Cyclone Kenneth.  It hit Mozambique late last week.  At that time, its wind speeds were 140 miles per hour.  That`s the equivalent 
 
 of a category four hurricane, out of five, but Kenneth was the most powerful storm ever to hit Mozambique.  The nation`s government says almost 
 
 3,400 homes have been destroyed, and more than 18,000 people are displaced. 
 
At least 38 people died.  One uniquely destructive thing about Cyclone Kenneth, it`s slow.  When a hurricane or a cyclone doesn`t pass over an 
 
 area quickly, it can drop even more rain than it normally would, and that can make flooding even worse.  Over the course of this week, forecasters 
 
 expect up to 20 inches of more rain.
 
Save the Children, an international aid group, says survivors in areas of heavy damage need food, water and shelter urgently.  But workers haven`t 
 
 been able to get to some areas, because rivers have flooded and covered roads.  Cyclone Kenneth killed four people on the island nation of Comoros, 
 
 which is about 100 miles east off the coast of Mozambique.  
 
The Mozambique and island of Ibo looks like it took a direct hit.  Mozambique is not a wealthy country.  More than 46 percent of its 
 
 population is estimated to live in poverty, and natural disasters like this are part of the reason.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
 
ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Two major cyclones hit Mozambique in just a matter of weeks.  It`s unprecedented.  And of course, as the country 
 
 tries to recover from the devastation of Cyclone Idai, another stronger storm hits the northern parts of Mozambique.  Cyclone Kenneth hits the 
 
 country in the early hours of Friday, and Mozambicans woke up to strong winds and heavy rainfall.
 
But two major cities that are very densely-populated in the northern parts of Mozambique were not as severely impacted.  The eyewitness accounts and, 
 
 of course, business that we spoke to say that it wasn`t as bad as they feared and it`s basically business of usual.  But it`s 80 kilometers north 
 
 of Pemba where the catastrophe did occur on the Island of Ibo.  
 
According to a resort manager there, 90 percent of the homes were totally destroyed on the island.  And it seems that that is where the eye of the 
 
 storm passed through. Now, remember that this part of Mozambique isn`t as densely-populated as the rest of the country.  It`s also very remote.  
 
 We`re talking about villages that are not easily accessible.

AZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Which of these countries borders the Sea of Lkhostsk: China, Kazakhstan, Ukraine or Japan?  This body of water is 
 
 surrounded mostly by Russia, but is also bordered by Northern Japan.
 
Emperor Akihito was the first Japanese royal to marry a commoner.  He was the first Japanese emperor to visit China, Thailand and the Philippines.  
 
 And today, he becomes Japan`s first royal in 200 years to advocate to give up his throne.  The role of emperor is symbolic in Japan.  The decision-
 
 making power lies in the hands of its elected politicians.  
 
But as that symbol of national unity, Emperor Akihito has been popular, and many Japanese are sad to see him step down.  In a rare televised address in 
 
 2016, the emperor said he was worried that his age and fitness level would make it harder for him to carry out his duties as he had until then.  
 
The next year, Japan`s parliament passed the law that allowed him to advocate if he wanted to.  And on Wednesday, his son, Crown Prince Naruhito 
 
 will become the 126th emperor to ascend to Japan`s Chrysanthemum Throne, the name given both to the emperor`s position and to his seat, used during 
 
 the coronation ceremony.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Crown Prince Naruhito inherits the Chrysanthemum Throne at a time of transition for Japan.  Once the region`s 
 
 economic powerhouse, today, the Japanese economy is struggling.  The population, ageing and the workforce, shrinking.
 
The royal family is also shrinking.  Women are leaving and giving up their official duties.  The law says if a woman marries anyone outside of her own 
 
 18-member imperial family, she automatically becomes a commoner.  A man keeps his royal status for life.  As each princess marries and becomes a 
 
 commoner, the royal family keeps shrinking, fewer people to fulfill all the responsibilities.
 
TSUNEYASU TAKEDA, AUTHOR:  You`re exactly right.  And I believe that a certain number of Imperial family members are needed, as the number has 
 
 been increasing rapidly.
 
RIPLEY:  Japan used to have many noble families, but after the war, just one.  Now, they`re the royal equivalent of an endangered species.  Japan 
 
 also used to allow women to sit on the Chrysanthemum Throne, but that was centuries ago.  Today, it`s a different story.  The crown prince and 
 
 princess only have one child, 17-year-old Princess Aiko. 
 
Under current law, she cannot ascend to the throne, so her cousin, 12-year- old Prince Hisahito will be second in line after the abdication.  Conservative commentator and Imperial author Tsuneyasu Takeda argues 
 
 against women reigning again.  The reason, preserving the male bloodline of the world`s-oldest, continuous, heredity monarchy.  
 
Why is it necessary for the - for the emperor to be a male?
 
TAKEDA:  First, it`s essential to know why the emperor is an emperor.  I think it`s very important as an emperor, historically, is of the principle 
 
 of pedigree. 
 
RIPLEY:  But does that mindset put the whole existence of the royal family at risk?  I mean what if there isn`t a male heir?  What if a male isn`t 
 
 born?  Then what?
 
TAKEDA:  This male line succession has been in effect for more than 2,000 years.  There was some periods when succession became difficult, but 
 
 historically, they solved the problem, not by putting a daughter or sister of the emperor on the throne but by bringing in someone who had the male 
 
 line pedigree, even if he was a distant relative.
 
RIPLEY:  But can the Japanese public continue to accept an Imperial family, perceived by some as outdated, out of touch?   The Japanese government will 
 
 soon discuss whether succession law needs to change.  Some argue, if it doesn`t, the Imperial family faces an uncertain future.

AZUZ:  When someone is set to receive an organ transplant, doctors have only a matter of hours to get the organ to the recipient.  Kidneys, lungs 
 
 and livers simply don`t survive very long when being transferred.  Many human organs are transported on airplanes.  But some researchers are 
 
 testing out drones as a way to speed up to the process.  
 
There are a number of obstacles to doing this.  For one thing, the most recent test, which was successful, only covered a couple miles.  Experts 
 
 say drones would need engines, not batteries, in order to carry an organ cross-country.  Drone technology is still relatively new.  There`re 
 
 concerns about how reliable it is. 
 
And the Federal Aviation Administration still has strict rules concerning drones.  Aslo, some wouldn`t be able to lift the machines that keep organs 
 
 functioning, and special coolers will have to be developed to safely transport them.  Still, the technology could save lives.

NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From West Baltimore, a drone carrying a human organ launches.  It lands 2.8 miles away at the University of 
 
 Maryland Medical Center.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Confirming (inaudible) active, temperature`s appropriate, organ doesn`t appeared to be injured at all.
 
CHEN:  The kidney is then successfully transplanted into a patient, saving her life.  The first of its kind voyage has the potential to revolutionize 
 
 the organ transplant process.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This will have a direct impact on improving patient outcomes, where time is critical.  
 
CHEN:  When performing an organ transplant, figuring out how to get it to the recipient quickly is often the most complicated part.  Any delays can 
 
 destroy the organ`s viability.  
 
JOSEPH SCALEA, DOCTOR:  The system is broken and it needs to be fixed.  It takes too long, it is unsafe, and it is way too expensive.
 
CHEN:  The new technology has the potential to make it cheaper, faster and more reliable.  It could also widen the donor organ pool and improve access 
 
 for people in rural communities.  The University of Maryland is now working with three organ procurement organizations across the country to slowly 
 
 begin implementing drone use.

AZUZ:  Yoga with baby goats, 10 out of 10.  A person who took part in this said she figured it`d be, quote, &amp;quot;Yoga with goats running around,&amp;quot; and 
 
 that`s pretty much what it was at this event in Kansas.  Now, the animals do tend to get in the way, and that`s all part of the fund. 
 
And a farm representative says your hair and clothes are at risk of getting a serious nibble.  But if you don`t mind a downward-facing goat, with your 
 
 downward-facing dog, then you`ll probably want to nama-stay for more.  You`ll sub breathing for bleeding, posture for pasture, agility for 
 
 futility.  If this very idea gets your goat and you feel like you got a bad workout, hey, at least you`ll have a scapegoat.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hi, I`m Carl Azuz for CNN 10.  Welcome to everyone watching worldwide.  It`s great to see you this Monday.  The month 
 
 of April is drawing to a close and this Friday the first Friday of the new month, the U.S. governments latest jobs report is due out.  It will look at 
 
 economic indicators like the unemployment rate.  The percentage of the American workforce that doesn`t have a job.  For the past two months it`s 
 
 been at 3.8 percent considered a very low rate and a good sign for the economy.  The report monitors whether wages are growing and by how much.  
 
 Wage growth can be a good sign and it will examine the number of jobs that were added to the economy in April.
 
That`s statistic has been a rollercoaster this year.  Hiring boomed in January with more than 300,000 jobs added.  The number dropped dramatically 
 
 in February with less than 35,000 added and it bounced back in March with just under 200,000 new jobs.  Predicting what the economy will do, how much 
 
 it will grow is done by looking at information like this and by reading the trends in the U.S. stock market.  Christine Romans from CNN Money explores 
 
 how it continues to rise and what could slow that down in the months ahead. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CHRISTINE ROMANS, ANCHOR OF CNN MONEY:  Resilience is still the word in stocks after one of the best first quarters in years.  April brings the 
 
 major U.S. averages close to record highs.  This year the NASDAQ is up more than 20 percent, the S&amp;amp;P 500 up 16 percent, the Dow up 13 percent.  The Dow 
 
 is now up more than 40 percent since the election.  Now so far the beginning of earnings season hasn`t changed this narrative.  Yes, profit 
 
 growth is expected to turn negative in the first quarter but guess what?  Investors largely saw that coming.  
 
The U.S. economy is growing and the job market is strong.  Wages are beginning to pick up but overall inflation is low.  There`s enough 
 
 confidence in the markets and the economy to bring a wave of tech start ups public, so called &amp;quot;unicorn&amp;quot; parade of IPOs.  Ten years into an economic 
 
 expansion and J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told shareholders the expansion could run for years more.  What could go wrong?  Well plenty.  
 
 The early benefits of new tax laws in the U.S. are beginning to fade, rising gas prices could bite consumers.  Oil prices are up 35 percent this 
 
 year and the average price of gas in the U.S. jumped almost 10 cents in a recent week.
 
America`s trade wars are ongoing and trade talks unfinished.  Beware of breakdown in trade talks with China or a worsening trade situation between 
 
 the U.S. and it`s largest trading partner the European Union.  President Trump has until May to decide whether to slap tariffs up to 25 percent on 
 
 European car imports.  Any of these factors could make the historic stock market run a lot more vulnerable. 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
AZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  According to the Pew Research Center, 77 percent of Americans have what?  Is it a smartphone, landline, dog or passport?  
 
 Smartphones are the answer here and cell phones in general are owned by 95 percent of Americans. 
 
A debate is raging over kids and screen time.  How much of the day they should spend in front of TVs, smartphones, tech?  The World Health 
 
 Organization recently released guidelines on this.  It says for young kids, screen time needs to be limited to an hour a day or less.  That`s similar 
 
 to a recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  Experts say too much screen time early in life is associated with delays in language 
 
 skills, social skills, even the brain`s ability to think.  But there are other studies that suggest limited screen time, especially with educational 
 
 apps or programs can encourage creativity and sometimes problem solving skills.  So the research is mixed.  In some classrooms for older kids, 
 
 administrators have found a place for artificial intelligence.  What`s not known is whether this could be a substitute for old school education. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A timeless scene that has been played out in schools around the world for centuries.  Young students enjoying their break 
 
 between lessons.  But back in the classroom of this school in Abu Dhabi, a transformation is happening.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In this lesson, you learn to solve equations with rational coefficients.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whiteboards, markers and books have been replaced with interactive calendars, digital avatars and laptops.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Let`s solve this equation together. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fourteen year old Mari Amahamad (ph) is just one of 25,000 students in the UAE and the U.S. being taught through the Olive 
 
 Education Platform.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When you are using books it was like so boring, so it`s nice to use (inaudible) traditional way.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Founded in Abu Dhabi in 2015, the online program is using technology to disrupt traditional education in the classroom.  
 
 Children are encouraged to create their own avatar.  And through the use of videos, animation, digital content and questions along the way, the Olive 
 
 Platform aids learning.  At its headquarters in Abu Dhabi in a secure control room, analysts use artificial intelligence to make sense of the 
 
 reams of information coming in.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We capture millions of data points on a daily basis.  The human cannot process that many data points. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The premise is simple.  If a pupil struggles with a concept, the system adapts and presents the lesson again in a form more 
 
 tailored to the student.  The result is reframing the future of education. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wouldn`t it be great if you could look at artificial intelligence and data to drive kids into the right careers, into the right 
 
 choices post secondary education?  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When it comes to adopting AI technology, the United Arab Emirates is one country leading the way.  But with artificial 
 
 intelligence expected to generated $96 billion towards the economy by 2030, some are worried that this technology comes at a cost, with a growing 
 
 debate over whether the benefits outweigh increased screen time for children or potential privacy concerns.

AZUZ:  U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that one in 59 children in America has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.  It can 
 
 involve problems communicating, bonding emotionally or repeating the same behaviors.  Dr. Wendy Ross was named a CNN Hero in 2014 for her work to 
 
 help children on the spectrum take part in every day activities.  Now she`s helping the medical industry better understand patients with Autism 
 
 Spectrum Disorder. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
DR. WENDY ROSS:  Hey.  How are you?  Hi, Alex (ph).  Patients coming in on the spectrum may have a more difficult time communicating.  Those with 
 
 autism also have heart attacks or cancer and without doctors that can understand how to interact with them, they`re not going to get appropriate 
 
 healthcare. 
 
Alex, I know you`ve been using the letter board but can you tell me, what was it like to be unable to communicate for so long?  
 
My patient Alex Lapeck (ph), despite being nonverbal actually has an IQ that is very, very high.  
 
ALEX TRANSLATED:  It was frustrating.  I had some tough days but the first time I spelled openly, I knew my life had changed forever.  
 
ROSS:  You never want to underestimate somebody`s ability but then again doctors need to understand for someone on the autism spectrum who doesn`t 
 
 often look at faces.  That pain scale, that`s not really a good way of monitoring their pain.  Some of the accommodations that our program 
 
 provides are noise cancelling headphones.  Things like fidgets to help reduce their anxiety.  We are really providing autism friendly healthcare.  
 
 What would you like to tell other people about you and other people on the spectrum?  
 
ALEX TRANSLATED:  They are so thirsty to learn.  Our brains are like sponges.  
 
ROSS:  Alex has a lot to say and so he`s really become a huge part of our program in terms of consultation, on making things autism friendly.  What 
 
 was the moment, like, when you realized that other people could understand you?
 
ALEX TRANSLATED:  It was like the Eagles winning the Super Bowl. 
 
ROSS:  We want those on the spectrum to exceed everyone`s expectations including their own and we would like to exceed everyone`s expectations in 
 
 the care that we deliver.  
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
AZUZ:  A lot of kids with dogs know the animals only wish they could ride the school bus.  Now, they can.  A man in Portland, Oregon offers a service 
 
 that picks up pups in a custom van.  He takes them to a large fenced in pasture that`s like this giant dog park for the day so they can run, play 
 
 and be dogs.  Then he takes them back home.  One difference between this and school recess though, sometimes kids are allowed to join the animals on 
 
 a play date.  
 
So in this case the kids and the van have gone to the dogs.  Wonder if the animals &amp;quot;hound&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;pug&amp;quot; their owners about this?  &amp;quot;Barking&amp;quot; about how they 
 
 like staying home &amp;quot;mastiff&amp;quot; the time but love their &amp;quot;Newfoundland&amp;quot; of recess and wish they could &amp;quot;skipperkey&amp;quot; over &amp;quot;terrier&amp;quot; more &amp;quot;offenventure&amp;quot;.  
 
 From time to time they got to let out their &amp;quot;rot wilder&amp;quot; side.  I`m Carl Azuz now making a &amp;quot;bark load&amp;quot; of puns for CNN.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.  Fridays are awesome.  Shakespeare couldn`t have said that any better.  I`m 
 
 Carl Azuz for CNN 10.  We`re grateful to have you wrapping up the week with us.  We start with a milestone for the measles.  This year there`ve been at 
 
 least 681 cases of the disease stretched across 22 U.S. states.  That`s the highest number on record since the measles was declared eliminated from the 
 
 U.S. in the year 2000.  Being eliminated doesn`t mean its completely gone, it means the country went more than 12 months without people continuously 
 
 catching the disease.
 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says the current outbreaks are linked to people who traveled to other countries and brought the measles back with 
 
 them.  No one has died in the outbreaks.  Most of children who`ve been infected were not fully vaccinated against the measles though some were and 
 
 caught it anyway.  The vaccine offered in America isn`t just for the measles.  It`s called MMR, standing for measles, mumps, and rubella.  The 
 
 three diseases it aims to prevent.  Doctors recommend two doses of this vaccine in early childhood.  
 
The CDC says there`s a remote chance that the MMR vaccine can cause side effects and even serious injuries which is why some parents are holding off 
 
 on getting it for their children.  But experts say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.  Measles is highly contagious.  Symptoms 
 
 include high fevers, coughing, and a skin rash.   
 
10 Second Trivia.  Which of these U.S. cities was founded in 1625?  New Amsterdam, St. Augustine, Savannah, or Jamestown.  What`s now New York City 
 
 was originally founded by 17th century Dutch settlers, hence the name New Amsterdam.  
 
In the late 17th century, what had become the city of New York had an estimated population of less than 8,000 people.  Today that populations 
 
 more than 8 million.  It`s the most populated city in America but that`s not its only change.  The island of Manhattan has grown, vertically of 
 
 course with skyscrapers but outwardly as well as dirt and the garbage generated by all those people was used to expand the area they could live 
 
 on.  Today we`re joining a local architecture critic for a tour of New York City`s ever changing waterfront. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can only think of New York as having five burroughs, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.  But there`s 
 
 really a sixth burrough and it`s the largest which is the water that connects the other five.  So the first pier in New York started right here.  
 
 Standing here you don`t really feel like you`re in a maritime city.  You don`t feel like you`re close to the water but in New Amsterdam days this 
 
 was really the edge of Manhattan and everything from here to what is now the river is landfill. 
 
It`s really the most profitable kind of recycling.  If you take garbage, put in the water and turn it into real estate.  One of the best places to 
 
 get a sense of how the city has changed and the waterfront has changed is right here, Pier 15.  It`s a wonderful example of the way, a relatively 
 
 small, relatively modest design intervention can create a space people really didn`t know about.  So this is Swasen`s Landing, this is the entry 
 
 point to Governor`s Island and if you take the ferry from Manhattan it`s just a five minute ferry ride.  Everybody disembarks here and then finds 
 
 their ways to different points on the island. 
 
And there`s a map which shows you the two parts of the island.  The original Governor`s Island, which was where the Dutch first settled, and 
 
 then all of this is landfill.  I`m here in Brooklyn Bridge Park which is a wonderful place to tell the story of New York`s tempestuous love affair 
 
 with the water and the waterfront.  And right where we`re standing here was just a oily, polluted shoreline isolated behind chain link fences that you 
 
 really couldn`t access.  It was really kind of an abandoned area of the city.  
 
Now thanks to 20 years of - - of landscaping of (inaudible), this park is now full of people.  It`s a destination park not just a neighborhood park.  
 
 To me this story of New York re-embracing its waterfront is a very optimistic one.  It`s not just about the waterfront.  It`s really about the 
 
 idea of seeing some of the hardest hit areas of the city.  Some of the weaknesses and finding the imagination and the long term commitment to 
 
 build something new.

AZUZ:  Picking back up today on our Positive Athlete Series.  It features people like Caden Westwick (ph), a volleyball player in California.  He`s 
 
 helping his community clean up from the very mudslide that destroyed his home and every possession he had in it.  If you know someone like Caden 
 
 (ph), you can nominate him or her at CNN.com/positive athlete.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
CADEN WESTWICK (PH):  My name`s Caden Westwick.  I`m a junior at Santa Barbara High and I play volleyball.  About a year ago I lost the house I 
 
 was renting in the mudslides.  These boulders here are just the remains of the actual mudslides.  They came from pretty much everywhere and these, I 
 
 guess, were just rushing all around our house.  I woke up all at once to the house just shaking.  
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 
WESTWICK (PH):  Probably one of the scariest things I`ve ever witnessed.  I`m pretty lucky actually to have made it out.  And this was my room in 
 
 which got totally wiped out.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This isn`t an exaggeration.  You were homeless. 
 
WESTWICK (PH):  Yes.  I`ve think we (inaudible) 10 different houses ever since until we finally settled.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tragedy happens and then all of a sudden he goes, oh I`m going to go help out the community and help with the &amp;quot;bucket brigade&amp;quot;.  
 
 I mean, that is just astounding, kind of gives me goose bumps. 
 
WESTWICK (PH):  So what the &amp;quot;bucket brigade&amp;quot; does is we`re pretty much just restoring the trails that were almost completely destroyed after the 
 
 mudslides and just making them accessible for people to use again.  You can see on the trees the mudslide was like 15 feet high.  You can see the mark 
 
 of the mud and we pretty much just went in there and tried to clear it all out.  I lost, well, for one just my school backpack, all my textbooks.  I 
 
 mean, everything in my room, all my clothes, my bed.  I mean, even just stuff that I like to use like my camera, sports - - like volleyballs, 
 
 sports equipment.  It`s a little challenging but its pretty rewarding just because I feel like I`m helping the community after all the help they gave 
 
 me.

 grass but there were many of them and for a while they weren`t going anywhere.  Finally when Scott Russo (ph) assumed the role of shepherd and 
 
 led them back through the gate, while his wife jumped on the trampoline and shook a tambourine the sheep retreated.  
 
Of course the gate is now in &amp;quot;sheep shape&amp;quot; and the shepherd broke a sweater to make them &amp;quot;evacuate&amp;quot;.  It was like a &amp;quot;flood gate&amp;quot; to a &amp;quot;baaadbovadate&amp;quot;.  
 
 They went &amp;quot;fleeting&amp;quot; all while &amp;quot;bleating&amp;quot; in a pretty &amp;quot;sheepish state&amp;quot;.  Is the grass greener?  Well we guess it all depends when a wooly stubborn 
 
 flock, flocks to a &amp;quot;residence&amp;quot;.  What a way to end a week, what a need to mend a fence.  We are dropping &amp;quot;sick bleats&amp;quot; on CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Vladivostok, a city in the far eastern part of Russia is the scene of today`s first story on CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.  Hope 
 
 your Thursday`s going well.  Russia is one of the three countries that border North Korea.  It shares a tiny 11 mile stretch of land with Russia 
 
 and that`s what North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Un crossed this week for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  They`re scheduled to meet 
 
 Thursday in the city of Vladivostok.  It will be the first time ever these two leaders have met face to face. 
 
North Korean Dictator Kim says he hopes to quote &amp;quot;discuss issues of resolving the situation on the Korean Peninsula and developing the two 
 
 countries relations.&amp;quot;  Analysts say that might included trade.  China is North Korea`s only real trading partner.  The country could benefit by 
 
 having others like Russia but the international sanctions, the penalties on North Korea`s economy could also factor in here.  Experts say Chairman Kim 
 
 can be looking for Russian support in getting some of those sanctions removed.  
 
We`ve told you how he met with U.S. President Donald Trump for their second ever summit in February.  That ended without a deal.  The two sides didn`t 
 
 agree on the issues of sanctions relief for North Korea in exchange for the communist nation giving up its nuclear weapons program.  So at a time 
 
 where`s there an impasse between North Korea and the U.S. and heightened tensions between Russia and the U.S., officials around the world are 
 
 curious to see what happens when Chairman Kim and President Putin get together.  For months Russia and the United States have been flexing their 
 
 military muscles on the global stage.

(JON HUNTSMAN), AMBASSADOR TO MOSCOW:  You have 200,000 tons of diplomacy that is cruising in the Mediterranean.  This is what I call diplomacy.  
 
 This is forward deployed diplomacy.  Nothing else needs to be said.  You have all the confidence you need when you sit down and you try to find 
 
 solutions to the problems that have divided us now for many, many years.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  CNN was on board as the USS Abraham Lincoln and the John C. Stennis are going to conduct operations on a scale unseen here 
 
 since 2016.  All this in an area where Russia is trying to expand its influence deploying more warships and submarines with cruise missiles.  The 
 
 U.S. military is extremely concerned about Russia`s increasingly strong military posture in this region and with this deployment America is making 
 
 clear to Moscow that it (inaudible).  The U.S. Navy is also assuring Americas allies that it won`t waiver on commitments to protect against

AZUZ:  At least 156 people in 10 U.S. states have been infected by e coli.  It`s an abbreviation for Escherichia coli, the name of a bacteria.  The 
 
 U.S. Center for Disease Control says those who`ve gotten sick had eaten tainted ground beef at home and in restaurants.  Twenty of the victims have 
 
 been hospitalized but no one has died.  There`s a ground beef supplier in Georgia that`s recalled more than 113,000 pounds of raw ground beef because 
 
 of possible e coli contamination.  The company says those items were produced starting in late March and the current outbreak began weeks before 
 
 that on March 1st.   
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  E coli is a type of bacteria.  It lives in your intestines and it lives in the intestines of animals.  Most of the time e 
 
 coli is harmless.  You`re not going to get sick but there are some strains that can get you sick e coli O157H7 is a particularly dangerous strain of e 
 
 coli.  You can get it from undercooked ground meat.  You can get it from vegetables, from unpasteurized milk, in juice, from soft cheeses.  While it 
 
 is found in vegetables, ultimately an animal is the source.  So animal waste some how has come in contact with crops.  
 
Children and adults with weakened immune systems, they`re the most vulnerable to getting very sick.  The signs of e coli poisoning are nausea 
 
 and vomiting, abdominal pain, cramps, fatigue and fever.  Most people who get sick from e coli, they recover in five to 10 days but some people they 
 
 get really sick.  Their organs can shut down and they can die.  There are things that you can do to prevent an e coli infection.  Wash your fruits 
 
 and vegetables.  Cook your meats thoroughly, use a thermometer and get that thermometer up to 160 degrees.  There`s no cure for an e coli infection. 
 
 Antibiotics don`t work.  So the best thing you can do is to keep yourself hydrated and keep yourself rested.

AZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  On which of these animals would you find a plastron? Arabian horse, sea turtle, garter snake, or snow crab.  A 
 
 plastron is the underside of a tortoise or turtle`s shell.  So the sea turtle is the only animal here that has one. 
 
Sea turtles are endangered and its illegal in several countries to interfere with them in any way.  But there`s a U.S. based environmental 
 
 organization that gives people the chance to catch sea turtles so they can be tagged and researched.  The cost is about $3,000 per person. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You feel a connection with the sea turtles when you`re swimming with them.  You know, its just - - its incredible.  It`s an 
 
 absolute incredible experience, truly once in a lifetime for us.  It is magical here.  I mean, the beaches are beautiful.  I`ve never in my life 
 
 seen water like (inaudible). 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It really is one of the most beautiful places on the planet I think.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I`m Katherine (ph) and this is David (ph) and we`re from Tampa, Florida and we`re here volunteering with Earthwatch to help 
 
 research the sea turtles. 
 
(KATHERINE):  I`ve always loved sea turtles.  Growing up I`ve always collected turtles and because they`re an endangered species Earthwatch is 
 
 really the only way that we could get close to them.  
 
(DAVID):  We`re just on the look out on an Earthwatch website waiting for this trip to come up and then we signed up.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  413.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My name is Annabelle Brooks (ph) and I am the lead scientist for the (inaudible) in the Bahamas project and with Earthwatch we 
 
 have volunteers that come in and help in the field.  So they`re actually out there helping us capture the turtles so that we can collect the data 
 
 that we need to (inaudible).  We import them biological (inaudible) passions.  Line two. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Once we bring the turtles to the beach, we`re measuring their shell.  We`re measuring its head.  We`re taking pictures of 
 
 the sea turtles.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We`re also then tagging them so that in the future if we - - we catch that individual, we`ll know exactly who they are, how much 
 
 they`ve grown and how they`re - -  they`re developing.  So I get this huge amount of information.  So that way we`re not going to capture again today 
 
 mister. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Catching a sea turtle is really difficult.  We`re on a boat and we`re kind of driving around an area that we think there`s going 
 
 to be quite a number of sea turtles.  We`ll spot a sea turtle.  We`ll follow it in the boat and - - and one person will jump off the boat and 
 
 they`ll swim to try and be able to catch the sea turtle.  Turtles are 100 percent faster than us. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They`re - - they`re much quicker underwater than I - - I really thought. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The best is when they`re right below you and you`re swimming overtop of them and its just like you and the turtle are swimming 
 
 together.  And it`s like, I just - - I don`t want to stop this, like yes, let`s just continue to swim like this but then you think like, OK, 
 
 Annabelle (ph) needs our help with (inaudible) research so I like should.  I - - I - - I need to catch (inaudible).  
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The most amazing thing about Earthwatch expeditions is that working with scientists who have the permits and the skills to be 
 
 able to do this work.  You get to do things that you would never be able to do. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I just caught a (inaudible) sea turtle.

AZUZ:  Gorilla selfie might make you picture an animal playing with a camera.  In this case, the animal`s were posing for the camera.  A park 
 
 ranger in the Democratic Republic of Congo took this.  He had helped rescue the gorillas when they were babies.  Virunga National Park says most 
 
 primates are comfortable doing this for short periods of time . It hopes the pictures popularity will help with conservation efforts.  The ranger 
 
 wrote simply, another day at the office. 
 
But the really, really good one.  It`s hard to feel &amp;quot;lowland&amp;quot; when you have gorillas stand up for you.  They`re willing to pose but not &amp;quot;pose a 
 
 threat&amp;quot;.  They`ve gotten up on their own two feet.  They`re not trying to &amp;quot;bamboozle&amp;quot; anyone.  In short, they look like they`d make &amp;quot;primates&amp;quot;.  
 
 That`s our stance on CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  As the summer travel season gets closer, airfares could be climbing along with the planes themselves.  The likely 
 
 reasons why are our first topic today on CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.  Welcome to the show.  U.S. economy is strong.  Unemployment is near a record low 
 
 point.  So more people will be looking to travel this summer.  Jet fuel prices have increased and they`re expected to get higher.  That can limit 
 
 the routes the airlines will want to take since some won`t be as profitable and that can increase ticket prices.  And then there are issues with 
 
 Boeing, one of the worlds biggest airplane manufacturers has had its best selling passenger jet grounded around the world. 
 
371 planes, all of them in Boeing 737 Max series were taken out of service last month.  That happened after two catastrophic crashes, one near 
 
 Indonesia in October and one in Ethiopia in March.  Everyone aboard those flights was killed.  Boeing`s been working to improve the safety of its 737 
 
 Max series planes.  After they were grounded, the company had to temporarily stop delivering them to the airlines that ordered them.  That 
 
 hurt Boeing significantly because most of the money for a plane is paid when it`s actually delivered.  
 
Those deliveries are expected to pick back up later this year when the 737 Max aircraft are approved to fly again.  The impact on Boeing`s finances 
 
 could become clearer on Wednesday when it releases its latest financial report.  The impact on Boeing`s reputation is harder to and it`s difficult 
 
 to say when either of these challenges will be overcome. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Only weeks away from the start of the summer travel season, and there`s no end in sight to Boeing`s woes.  The entire fleet of 
 
 737 jets still grounded.  In the U.S., American Airlines and Southwest are canceling hundreds of flights through August.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It`s our responsibility to eliminate this risk.  We own it and we know how to do it. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Boeing said it would shrink monthly production of all 737s by 20 percent while it works to deliver a software fix for the Max.  
 
 Last week, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said that work was almost done. 
 
DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO OF BOEING:  I had the opportunity to participate in another demonstration flight that saw first hand this software in its final 
 
 form operating as designed across a range of flight conditions. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The pressure from investors is building upon Boeing.  Shares are down nearly 15 percent since the start of March. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The company`s going to be extremely keen to get the existing fleet air born and to get deliveries of the - - the Max on the 
 
 production line underway.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The software fix is just the start of the long road back for Boeing. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You`re looking at emanate resolution the next couple of weeks.  What really matters though is getting all the regulatory bodies out 
 
 there on the world - - in the world comfortable with this fix and willing to implement it and that could take several additional months. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wall Street believes that even when the 737 Max`s are back in the air, Boeing still has a host of problems.  Bank of America 
 
 downgraded the company citing the cost of penalties owed to customers, a weaker negotiating position with airlines and operational inefficiencies 
 
 from the production disruption.  Returning the fleet to service will be a hard sell for a public that`s weary of Boeing`s promises on safety. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think there`s going to be an emphasis on hey, is - - is there an across the board culture problem here.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This has been a crisis of confidence in Boeings planes and one that won`t be solved neither cheaply or easily.

AZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Name the longest reigning monarch in British history.  Queen Elizabeth II, Queen Victoria, King George III, or King 
 
 Henry VIII.  Queen Elizabeth II, the nation`s current monarch, is reigned more than 67 years.  The longest reign in British history. 
 
The queen is planning to host U.S. President Donald Trump for a state visit this spring.  The United States and the United Kingdom, two close allies, 
 
 both made that announcement yesterday.  The event is scheduled for June 3rd through 5th.  The White House says it`s an opportunity to reaffirm the 
 
 steadfast relationship between the two countries.  British Prime Minister Teresa May said it would also be a chance to strengthen their cooperation 
 
 in trade, investment, security and defense. 
 
A state visit is a very formal event.  In Britain, it typically includes a horse parade and royal banquet.  Only two other U.S. presidents have been 
 
 invited to one since the queen ascended to the throne in 1952.  She first sent the American leader an invitation two years ago.  The countries have 
 
 been trying to work out the date since then.  
 
According the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, more than 50 percent of the garbage that Americans generate winds up in a landfill.  The good news 
 
 is, recycling and composting rates in America have increased dramatically since the 1980s.  The EPA estimates that more than a third of the trash we 
 
 produce gets recycled or composted.  The bad news is, there`s still a lot of recyclable material that`s thrown away and what might be the unexpected 
 
 news is that we`ve got to pay closer attention to what goes where.  A lot of garbage that looks recyclable actually isn`t and it can cause problems 
 
 for the facilities that process it. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you were thinking about putting that paper coffee cup into the recycling bin, you could be making the planets waste problem 
 
 even worse.  Some items that might seem right for recycling actually aren`t.  It`s called &amp;quot;wish-cycling&amp;quot; and it`s a big problem for waste 
 
 management companies.  Why?  Well recycling centers collect and sort items, then bundle the matching materials into large bales to sell back to the 
 
 companies that make new products out of those materials. 
 
If non-recyclable trash ends up in those bales, they are considered contaminated and the entire bale is taken to the dump wasting hundreds of 
 
 pounds of quality material.  Some common contaminants are coffee cups, plastic bags, greasy pizza boxes, non-recyclable plastics.  Pizza boxes can 
 
 only be recycled if they are not soiled by grease or food residue.  Plastic bags are not accepted at curbside bins because they clog up the sorting 
 
 machines.  However, they can be returned to many grocery stores to be properly recycled.  
 
Remember to look for the recycling symbol on items and check your local guidelines online before trying to recycle something.  This is important 
 
 because items like glass bottles, Styrofoam and plastics grade three through seven are not accepted at all recycling centers and could become 
 
 contaminants.  It`s going to take us all a little bit of working together and making an earnest effort to help keep our planet healthy and beautiful.

 unknown about sloths.  That`s what I love about them, that we`re - - everything that we`re discovering is new stuff.  The Sloth Sanctuary right 
 
 now is caring for 214 sloths.  We have reintroduced over the years 152.  We have 16 babies in the NICU nursery.  The rest are permanent residents. 
 
This is Stacy (ph).  Stacy (ph) was brought by the firefighters.  She had been burned by power lines so she`ll be a permanent resident.  There are 
 
 two completely different specifies of sloths.  One is the Bradypus, that is the three fingered sloth, three fingers and three toes.  The other specie 
 
 of sloth is the Choloepus.  He has three toes and two fingers but prehistorically they`re not related.  Sloths are energy efficient.  Sloths 
 
 are not lazy.  Sloths have a very slow metabolism.  They`ll - - what they`re eating today could take up to 30 days to get through their system. 
 
This is &amp;quot;Buttercup&amp;quot;.  She`s the sloth that started all of this.  (inaudible)
 
I love sloths.  My wish, my hope, my dream is to lift the sloths out of the darkness and let them people know them and appreciate them and - - and love 
 
 them and it`s happening.

AZUZ:  So are they slothful or just thoughtful?  Maybe they`re just &amp;quot;philoslothic&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Slother&amp;quot; them with questions but you`ll seldom see a 
 
 &amp;quot;sloth off&amp;quot; topic.  Hanging out or hanging in, they`re not hung up when hanging &amp;quot;round&amp;quot;.  Their cause, or claws or &amp;quot;escape claws&amp;quot; is when they drop 
 
 down to the ground.  They`re cut from different &amp;quot;claws&amp;quot; the sloths.  They`d &amp;quot;sloth&amp;quot; their sleep and threaten you.  Three toes or two, outside or in a

CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR:  Welcome back to our daily events coverage on CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz, thank you for taking 10 minutes for our show.  An 
 
 island country in the Indian Ocean is the scene of today`s first story.  
 
The nation of Sri Lanka is reeling from a series of terrorist attacks that targeted churches and hotels on Easter Sunday.  At least 290 people were 
 
 killed and 500 or more were injured with the coordinated attacks took place.
 
Most of them happened in the same timeframe between 8:45 and 9:30 on Sunday morning. Suicide bombers detonated their explosives at three churches 
 
 across the country.  
 
At around the same time more explosions took place at three luxury hotels in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo and later on Sunday there was a blast 
 
 at a hotel near a zoo and a final explosion happened in a private house as police were raiding it in connection with the previous attacks.
 
Officials don`t know yet why Christians were targeted.  Easter is their most important holiday but Christians are a religious minority in Sri 
 
 Lanka.  They account for about 7.5 percent of the population.
 
Buddhist make up 70 percent.  Hindus make up 12.5 percent and Muslims make up a little under 10 percent.  The Sri Lanka says its concern that an 
 
 international terrorist group is behind the assault.  
 
When we produced this show, no organization had admitted carrying them out but as Sri Lankan government spokesman says there were warnings days before 
 
 that attacks that something was going to happen and the government admitted yesterday that it failed to act on those warnings.
 
The Sri Lankan is on edge after a series of deadly terror attacks that ripped across parts of this country.  This church, St. Anthony Shrine, one 
 
 of three Catholic churches targeted on Easter Sunday.  You can still see shattered glass here.
 
And the clock tower frozen at roughly the time when a suicide bomber attacked during Easter Sunday prayers.  And in the 24 hours since, the 
 
 authorities are not taking any chances.  Look just down this road here you can see the remains of a suspicious vehicles that an explosive disposal 
 
 team detonated on Monday afternoon sending real fear through an already traumatized community.
 
This has been a series of deadly attacks; hundreds of people killed and wounded.  There has been criticism that the security forces missed a 
 
 warning from a foreign intelligence agency about threats of suicide attacks against Catholic churches prompting one government minister to accuse some 
 
 of these security chiefs of incompetence and negligence.
 
And also prompting a government spokesperson to publically apologize for letting this potentially crucial data of intelligence slip through the 
 
 authority`s fingers.  In the meantime, there has been no official claim of responsibility.  And some of the victims are still fighting for their lives 
 
 in the intensive care units of Sri Lankan hospitals.
 
Some leaning (ph) U.S. law makers spend Monday reviewing the Mueller report we mentioned last week.  The results of a special investigation led by 
 
 former FBI director, Robert Mueller.
 
The full report was released to Congress on Thursday but it had some redactions, some edits and a less edited version was given to House and 
 
 Senate leaders yesterday.  One main focus of the report concerned Russia.  Did the campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump illegally coordinate with 
 
 the other country to win the election.
 
The report said no that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian government.  Another part of the report concerned the U.S. leader`s 
 
 actions.  Did President Trump illegally interfere with the Mueller investigation and commit the crime of obstruction of justice.  
 
The report was more vague on that.  Investigators said they couldn`t conclude for sure that the president committed a crime but that they also 
 
 couldn`t conclude for sure that he didn`t.  It suggested that Congress could make its own investigation into that.
 
How politicians reacted to all this mainly depended on what political party they`re in.  President Trump and other republicans say the report 
 
 vindicates the president.  That he didn`t illegally cooperate with Russia and that it`s time to move on.
 
Democrats have said they need to see the full Mueller report without redactions and that Congress now needs to investigate whether the president 
 
 committed obstruction of justice.  We don`t know yet what the next steps will be in all this but we`ll keep you updated.

Ten second trivia, which of these U.S. cities is located the farthest west?  San Diego, California; Los Angeles, California; San Francisco, California; 
 
 or Seattle, Washington?  With 122.4 degrees west, just a tiny bit farther than Seattle is San Francisco, California.
 
Known as the city by the bay, San Francisco attracts tens of millions of people every year. That makes tourism the city`s biggest industry. That 
 
 industry is facing a number of challenges.  Homelessness is ramped throughout San Francisco.  So is drug use and the presents of drug 
 
 materials.  Many of the people who`ve traveled there in recent years have complained of feeling unsafe.  
 
Still tourism brings billions of dollars into the city every year.  People marvel at the Golden Gate Bridge. They imagine what it`d be like to try to 
 
 escape from Alcatraz and some to the braver drivers test their skills on Lombard Street.
 
A stretch of it has a 27 degree grade with sharp curves because paving it straight up and down in 1922 would have made it too steep for the cars of 
 
 that era to climb.  Lombard Street has another problem today though.  The sheer number of people who want to visit it.

UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  From draw (ph) view seven it`s easy to see why the crooked street attracts of tourist but from the ground residents have a 
 
 different perspective.
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  I moved here probably two years and it was nothing like this then. 
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  Gray Brunges (ph) says something has to be done to deal with the massive growth of tourist especially over the past 10 years.
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  Something (inaudible) that in itself is an issue.
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  They have to be acutely aware of how it impacts our residents.
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible) solution, setting up a reservation system and charging visitors $5 to drive the crooked road.  
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  This is how it works; register online, pick a day and time to visit, when your number`s called .
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  A license plate reader would verify it`s your time and then enjoy the ride.
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  Watch out, watch out.  (Inaudible).
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  The city has tried to fix the problem in the past with new signs and traffic control but they say nothing`s worked.
 
UNIDIENTIFIED FEMALE:  They have been unable to properly manage the crowds with the rapid growth of visitors.  
 
UNIDIENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you come this far then what`s $5?
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  But Audrey Felo (ph), who`s visiting with friends from Brazil doesn`t like the idea.  He says tourist shouldn`t be paying for the 
 
 cities problem.
 
UNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  I think this a (inaudible) thing so we should not pay for it.  Like we`re here to appreciate it and enjoy your time here.

AZUZ:  This probably isn`t what most people think of when we say robots pulling a truck.  But if you remember the four legged creature like Boston 
 
 Dynamics robots and you`ve picture 10 of them marching in unison while dragging something heavy, like some robotic sled dog army, then maybe you 
 
 did have this in mind.
 
Not everyone who saw this YouTube video was comfortable with it.  Some call the fear of robots technophobia, some say it`s robophobia (ph).  For anyone 
 
 uneasy with the sight, it certainly instills some kind of phobia.  
 
The company says it`s robot dogs will be available soon and where ever they`re trucked in, whether they`re transfer, road train, semi autonomously 
 
 wheeled somewhere of if they have to be big rigged up to something in tow, they could make a haul as long as nobodies dogged by the idea.  I`m Carl

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey.  Welcome to a special edition of CNN 10.  
 
Do you know that expression &amp;quot;you are what you eat&amp;quot;?  
 
Well, CNN has a &amp;quot;Raw Ingredient&amp;quot; series.  It looks at how the U.S. food industry has changed, how engineering and importing have replaced old-
 
 fashioned growing and how consumer demand still factors in to how the industry produces our food.  
 
Our reporter Cristina Alesci has gone inside some of America`s biggest food companies, seeing most people haven`t seen before.  
 
And today, we`re zooming in on animal feed and how what they eat ultimately makes its way to our plate.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CRISTINA ALESCI, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  I know I`m not supposed to do it, but every once in a while, it`s necessary -- burying my 
 
 face in the best barbecue I can find.
 
Americans eat a lot of meat.  On average, up to 126 pounds of poultry, beef and pork every year.  For some, it`s more than their own body weight.  
 
But depending on the animal, producing one pound of meat can take two, three, or even six pounds of feed.  And what some of our livestock is 
 
 eating are things you`d never put in your mouth.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We`re going this way.
 
ALESCI:  This is a hog finishing farm in Iowa.  It`s where pigs get fat.  
 
Over the course of five to six months, pigs go from about 13 pounds to 270 pounds in this room.  
 
(on camera):  Why did they get all quiet of a sudden? 
 
DAVID CALDERWOOD, PORK PRODUCER:  They want to hear what I have to say.  
 
ALESCI:  Wow, that`s amazing.  
 
(LAUGHTER)
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  The smell was awful, but, for me, the most unsavory part of this process is the one you rarely get to examine closely.  In 
 
 fact, it`s one of the most opaque corners of the meat industry.  It`s the animal feed itself.  
 
Most animals raised in this country eat a secret formula.  Some elements of the mix are even unknown to the farmer. But it`s safe to say that it 
 
 includes proteins, fats, and in many cases, drugs.  But the base for much of it is lots and lots of corn.
 
(on camera):  Do you feel like this is what you were born to do?
 
ROGER ZYLSTRA, CORN FARMER:  I feel this is what God put me on the earth for.
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Roger Zylstra has been farming corn for more than 30 years.  
 
(on camera):  This corn is not corn wheaties.
 
ZYLSTRA:  No.
 
ALESCI:  It`s not corn I put on my grill.
 
ZYLSTRA:  No, it is not.  We grow it as a commodity.  It really ultimately comes down to economics.  
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  And if it wasn`t for the meat industry, Roger might have a time staying in business, that`s because America`s livestock are 
 
 essentially just corn conversion machines.  
 
First, the corn travels to a storage facility like this one.  This is one million bushels, or 56 million pounds of corn.  And that`s just the 
 
 overflow from the massive storage containers.
 
JIM MAGNUSON, GENERAL MANAGER, KEN COOPERATIVE:  We need to hold a whole year`s worth of production at one time and then it`s metered out throughout 
 
 the remainder of the year.
 
ALESCI:  Nearly 40 percent of all the corn grown in the U.S. goes to animal feed.  
 
Rick Weigel makes hog feed.  
 
(on camera):  How many ingredients are looking at the end of the day?
 
RICK WEIGEL, HOG FEED PRODUCER, KEN COOPERATIVE:  Probably 10 to 12 different ingredients in.  
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  That includes pig fat.  So, yes, the pigs are eating pig fat.
 
One of the biggest feed-makers is 250 miles north, Cargill, in Minnesota.  
 
SARENA LIN, PRESIDENT, CARGILL ANIMAL AND NUTRITION:  We believe our purpose here is to be able to feed the world.  And to feed the world, we`ve 
 
 got to find the most efficient way to grow healthy animals.  So, we spend a lot of time doing the research to tackle exactly that question.  
 
ALESCI:  Cargill says it can get animals just as fat on half the feed compared to 40 years ago.  
 
But for many in the industry, it`s not just about less feed.  It`s about bigger animals.  
 
How do you get livestock to explode in size in a few months?  The industry has a term for it -- renderings.  Animal byproducts like meat and bone 
 
 meal, leftover grease from restaurants, and even meal made from poultry feathers.  
 
KEEVE NACHMAN, PHD, CENTER FOR A LIKABLE FUTURE, JOHNS HOPKINS:  To get a chicken to market weight, it takes between 42 and 48 days.  I mean, that`s 
 
 amazingly fast.
 
ALESCI:  Dr. Keeve Nachman investigates the impact of industrial food production on public health at Johns Hopkins.  One of his studies found 
 
 arsenic in chicken meat.  It came from a growth promotion drug in feed that has since been suspended by the FDA.
 
In another study, Nachman`s team found that some chicken feather meal contain small amounts of the active drugs in Tylenol, Benadryl and Prozac.  
 
An industry group rejected the findings, but Nachman stands by it.
 
NACHMAN:  No matter how they got there, these feathers are destined for use in animals.  That was surprising and a little troubling to us.
 
ALESCI:  Some producers even use waste, feeding cows and pigs what`s known as poultry litter, or simply put, chicken poop, which believe it or not is 
 
 considered a high protein, lower cost feed.
 
The FDA proposed banning the practice in 2004 to prevent mad cow disease.  The FDA decided against the regulation.  It said the science simply didn`t 
 
 justify a ban.  The FDA estimates that 1 percent of all chicken poop goes into feed.  
 
But none of the farmers I interviewed said they used it.
 
And there`s one more ingredient that`s essential to getting growth out of animals.  
 
(on camera):  Where are the drugs? 
 
WEIGEL:  They are in the drug room.  We hand-weigh them out and they`re dumped in each batch of feed.  
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Weigel says the majority of his customers request antibiotics in their feed.  This is where it comes from. 
 
We asked Keeve Nachman about the drugs we saw in this room.
 
NACHMAN:  I did see one drug that has an active ingredient called carbadox that has been shown to be carcinogenic and cause birth defects, at least in 
 
 animals.  And that drug has been banned in Canada, in the E.U., and in Australia.
 
It`s still approved for use here.
 
ALESCI:  But with some restrictions, which Weigel says he follows closely.
 
And get this: More than 70 percent of all antibiotics sold in the U.S. are for food production animals. 
 
JEFF DUNN, PRESIDENT, CAMPBELL`S FRESH:  When I tell people 75 percent of the antibiotics in this country go into the animal supply chain, it blows 
 
 their mind.  It`s not possible.  How can that be?  
 
Antibiotics are for humans.  It`s just not possible.  I mean, that blows their mind.  
 
ALESCI:  Jeff Dunn is trying to reform the food industry from the inside, at Campbell`s.
 
(on camera):  Why is that important?  Why should people care about that process?
 
DUNN:  Because the process --  
 
ALESCI:  For those who don`t care.  Because clearly there`s a subsection of society that does care, but there`s tons of other people that don`t care?
 
DUNN:  All of this costs money.  You know, none of this stuff comes free, and there`s a reason that amount of antibiotic was used by the meat 
 
 industry, because it was effective for them, it was efficient for them.  
 
Ultimately, if the low cost food requires us to do these things to animals in our food system that aren`t long-term healthy, how about we really 
 
 simply just externalize that costs than the long term health issues?
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Here`s why using so many antibiotics is a problem:
 
Antibiotics are vital drugs that can help us to defend from bacteria that make us sick, or even kill us.  
 
But bacteria can evolve.  Every time we use antibiotics, some bacteria survive and those drug resistant bacteria can then multiply and spread.  
 
 This can result in what many call a superbug.  
 
As we use more and more antibiotics, this problem magnifies, generating more kinds of superbugs and making the ones that already exist even more 
 
 powerful.  
 
There are already some strains of drug-resistant bacteria out there and public health officials warn it will only get worse if we don`t cool it on 
 
 the antibiotics.  
 
The FDA says it`s changing antibiotic guidelines for animal feed by December 2016.  Veterinarians will have to make sure the drugs are used 
 
 judicially and, quote, when needed for specific animal health purposes.
 
The feed-makers I spoke to said they follow FDA regulations.  But Nachman isn`t satisfied with the FDA or the industry.  
 
But is there an alternative?  Maybe going organic.
 
JAMES PETERSON, FARMS ORGANIC CORN AND SOYBEANS:  We are farming the same way that my great grandparents would have farmed.
 
ALESCI:  Without drugs, the same pound of meat will cost you more.
 
PETERSON:  The consumers are willing to pay.  I think there will be -- continue to be more demand. 
 
ALESCI:  And there`s the heart of it, demand for cheap meat.  We produce it as efficiently as possible and the conditions the animals lived in means 
 
 drugs are often used, not only to keep them alive, but to make them fat.  
 
Food executives say industrial methods are the only way we`re going to feed 9 billion people in the next three decades.  Maybe.  
 
But when you buy an unprocessed raw ingredient, do you know what`s really in it?  Where it`s been before it gets to your plate?  And whether it was 
 
 produced as safely as possible?
 
Right now, those questions are still too hard to answer.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Welcome to a special edition of CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.  
 
Today, we`re taking a look at inside the U.S. food supply, this time, zeroing in on produce.  We`re examining how engineering and importing have 
 
 replaced old fashion growing in the U.S. food industry, and how consumer demand still has the power to influence the industry.  
 
Our reporter Cristina Alesci has gone inside some of America`s biggest food companies, seeing what most folks haven`t seen before and getting 
 
 incredible insight as to how production affects what`s on our plate.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CRISTINA ALESCI, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Salad.  Americans are eating up to five times more leafy greens than they did 20 years ago.  
 
 We`re consuming three billion pounds a year.  But our intensifying love affair with fresh produce is creating problems for farmers, for the 
 
 environment, and even for our own health.  
 
One in six Americans, that`s 48 million people, get sick from contaminated food each year, 3,000 die.  That you think it`s coming from undercooked 
 
 meat and fish.  Well, produce is actually responsible for about half of the illnesses.  
 
MANSOUR SAMADPOUR, PHD, PRESIDENT, IEH LABORATORIES:  Any industry that wants to produce safe foods, they can do that.  
 
ALESCI:  Dr. Mansour Samadpour runs one of the nation`s largest food safety consulting labs.  Chipotle recently hired his company to assess and improve 
 
 safety standards after the government traced an outbreak of E. coli back to some of its stores.  He stocks listeria and salmonella in his office.  
 
SAMADPOUR:  This plate in theory is good enough to infect everyone in the city of Seattle.
 
ALESCI (on camera):  How could you get so close to it?  
 
SAMADPOUR:  Because they don`t jump.  
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Recently, the risk associated with some fruits and vegetables has become so high that the FDA begun actively monitoring them 
 
 for contaminants, a historic move for the agency.
 
So, how serious is the industry when it comes to keeping our food safe?
 
We traveled across the country to find out.  
 
It`s sunrise in Salinas Valley, California.  This area is called the &amp;quot;Salad Bowl of America&amp;quot; and for good reason.  Its fields produce 60 percent of the 
 
 leafy greens in the U.S.  
 
DIRK GIANNINI, FARMER:  I think farmers are the backbone of this nation, to be honest.
 
ALESCI (on camera):  I climb up on this side, right?
 
So, this is water that did this, that cut this?
 
GIANNINI:  Yes, it`s a water knife with extreme amount of pressure.  We`re trying to attract better workers and a better working environment for our 
 
 employees.
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Dirk`s family has been farming this land for four generations.
 
GIANNINI:  The amount of work that goes behind one head of lettuce is tremendous and the basic consumer has no idea of the intensity and the 
 
 dedication to a 10-acre block of romaine.
 
ALESCI:  Farming in this part of the world has gotten really rough.  Farmers are fighting a drought, a labor shortage and rising prices for 
 
 land, even some insiders say the industrial process is pushed to the brink.  
 
The president of Campbell`s Fresh is one of them.
 
(on camera):  What is the state of the food system?
 
JEFF DUNN, PRESIDENT, CAMPBELL`S FRESH:  I would say that it`s highly stressed.  The past 50 years of over-farming a lot of land has created real 
 
 problems on the global basis in terms of having enough irrigable farmland.  The word I`ve used is stressed almost from any dimension you look at.
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  And farming is just the beginning of the process.  And yes, I mean, process.
 
(on camera):  How cold is it in there?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It`s going to be about 34 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit in there.  The entire process is that cold.  
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Taylor Farms is the largest producer of fresh cut vegetables in the world.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Any given day, we`re going to have a million pounds of product come through this cooler.
 
ALESCI (on camera):  A million pound?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A million pound of products.
 
ALESCI:  Wow.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whether we dice, shred or shock, they`re going through several series of cutters and they immediately fall down into the beginning 
 
 of our wash process.
 
BRUCE TAYLOR, FOUNDER AND CEO, TAYLOR FARMS:  It kills Gram-negative bacteria, which is the bad stuff.  So, E. coli, salmonella and listeria.
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Taylor spent millions on the so-called smart wash system after spinach from another California company caused 200 people to 
 
 get sick and killed three.
 
TAYLOR:  You can`t eliminate -- there`s no kill stuff in our industry yet.  It`s still fresh products, so you can`t cook it or microwave it, or to do 
 
 something like that.
 
ALESCI (on camera):  How much of a setback was the outbreak in 2006 of E. coli?
 
GIANNINI:  I think that was a wake up call. 
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Beyond the human costs, it was a $300 million setback to the industry.
 
SAMADPOUR:  The current assumption is that the food is safe until proven otherwise.  We have made a lot of people sick over the years.  
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  You may be asking, how does a bacteria like E. coli or salmonella end up in your leafy greens?  It could be a variety of ways, 
 
 but the most common answer is waste.  
 
Manure is used to fertilize crops.  Animals like rodents or birds pick up the bacteria and then carry it into produce fields.  
 
SAMADPOUR:  People really need to understand what they are eating, where it has been grown.  You`re planning to travel to a country and they say, when 
 
 you go there, don`t eat salads and don`t drink water.  And then you find out that your salad is coming from that place.  
 
ALESCI:  And an appetite for year-round produce means the imports just keep coming.
 
TOM NASSIF, PRESIDENT AND CEO, WESTERN GROWERS:  Well, they always produces, but it wasn`t the kind of importing that`s being done now.  Every 
 
 year, we import more and more fresh produce from foreign countries.  We found that in many of the outbreaks, it comes from foreign producers.
 
ALESCI:  The government is trying to hold foreign producers to a higher standard, with the Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA -- the most 
 
 significant food safety law in 70 years.  The bill sets guidelines for how companies should prevent and respond to contamination.  
 
It sounds great.  The problem: funding.
 
(on camera):  How much more does the FDA really need to do its job right?
 
SAMADPOUR:  Much more than what they have been asking for.
 
ALESCI:  How much more?
 
SAMADPOUR:  Say they need probably minimum 10 times more resources, 10 times more resources.
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  The agency says it needs about $170 million more.  A lack of money and people might be one of the reasons the FDA has stopped 
 
 short of requiring routine government inspections of farms, according to critics.  Instead, it relies on third party auditors.  But the agency says 
 
 the new law gives the industry an accountability that didn`t exist before.  The goal it says is getting safer food to you.  
 
But with 48 million people getting sick each year, and an estimated $77 billion in costs, the price of failure is high.
 
(on camera):  Fresh food, it`s what everyone wants to eat more of, and the key to the healthy diet.  And technically, it`s supposed to make shopping 
 
 more simple.  There isn`t a laundry list of ingredients on a bag of carrots, right?  
 
But sometimes, shopping for raw ingredients could actually be more confusing than buying the packaged and processed stuff.  So, let me bring 
 
 it down for you.
 
(voice-over):  After reporting &amp;quot;Raw Ingredients&amp;quot;, people said, great, now that you`ve scared us, what can we buy that`s safe in the grocery story?  
 
 Should you buy organic produce?
 
Well, it kind of depends.  The government tracks chemical residues on our fruits and vegetables.  The worst culprits: apples, berries, cucumbers and 
 
 spinach.  It might be worth paying a premium for those.  
 
Or you could stick to fruits and vegetables that have fewer chemical deposits.  Think onions, sweet corn, cabbage and eggplant.  The cleanest: 
 
 avocados.
 
There is an emerging alternative, hydroponics, growing produce without soil, which is supposed to be much cleaner than an open field.
 
(on camera):  Fish, you want it low in contaminants and high in omega 3s, the good fatty acids.  
 
(voice-over):  Seafood like mackerel, shrimp and wild salmon.
 
Or look for pull caught fish.  Those tend to be younger, so they spent less time exposed to toxins. 
 
(on camera):  But what if your local store only stocks farm-raised salmon?
 
(voice-over):  Those can be higher in industrial chemicals stored in fish bag.  But experts say you can remove most of the bad stuff like trimming 
 
 away or cooking off the fat.
 
(on camera):  But enough with the veggies and fish, how about the meat?  Now, the ideal here is, find some companies that minimize antibiotics.
 
(voice-over):  The CDC says that all those drugs in our meat have created a public health threat known as a super bug.  So, look for these labels.  
 
 These third parties are supposed to ensure farmers are using drugs responsibly.
 
And here are a few marketing scams you should watch out for.  Terms like &amp;quot;natural and farm raised&amp;quot;.  Those don`t tell customers whether living 
 
 conditions for the animals are horrendous or pristine.
 
And while &amp;quot;hormone free&amp;quot; chicken sounds great, the FDA bans those in chickens, turkeys and hogs.
 
(on camera):  Bottom line: eat fresh food, just ask a few more questions.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Welcome to a new edition of CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.  Happy to see you this Thursday.  There is some news expected out of 
 
 Washington, DC today.  It concerns the Mueller Report, the special investigation by former FBI Director Robert Mueller.  It looked into 
 
 alleged Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election of 2016.  The Justice Department already released a summary of the report to 
 
 Congress, that happened last month.  It said the investigation did not find that the campaign of Donald Trump illegally conspired or coordinated with 
 
 Russia.  The Mueller Report didn`t draw a conclusion about whether President Trump obstructed justice, if he illegally interfered with 
 
 government work. 
 
But the summary said the U.S. Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General both concluded that there wasn`t sufficient evidence that the president had 
 
 done anything wrong.  So what`s happening today?  Well Democrats said the four page summary wasn`t enough.  They wanted to see the entire Mueller 
 
 Report of more than 300 pages.  That`s expected to be released today, though it`s also expected to be redacted meaning parts of it will likely be 
 
 edited or removed first.  CNN 10 is planning to follow up on this story next week. 
 
10 Second Trivia.  Which of these countries won its independence from Spain in 1811?  Brazil, Haiti, Venezuela, or Jamaica.  Only one of these 
 
 countries that won its independence from Spain is Venezuela.  
 
Venezuela`s leader is starting to let humanitarian aid into the country.  For years, President Nicolas Maduro has denied that there`s a crisis in 
 
 Venezuela but this week his government allowed the Red Cross to make its first delivery there.  The United Nations estimates that more than 20 
 
 percent of Venezuelans are in desperate need of supplies like medicine.  With its economy in shambles, a CNN investigation just found that illegal 
 
 drug trafficking through Venezuela is soaring.  The country accuses the U.S. and Colombia of trying to distract attention toward Venezuela to hide 
 
 their own defeat in the war on drugs.  But Nick Paton Walsh found first hand how Venezuela is becoming a major currier of cocaine. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Below is a cocaine super highway enriching Venezuela`s corrupt elite by (ph) bringing 
 
 coke to American streets.  These thin lines are secret pathways from Colombia`s cocaine farming heartland below, across into neighboring 
 
 Venezuela.  From there billions of dollars of the drug are smuggled north in tiny planes, U.S. and regional officials told CNN aided by Venezuela`s 
 
 army and elite.  The Colombian military we`re with don`t get any lower to stay out of the range of track (ph) and machine guns and talk to locals 
 
 mostly through the leaflets they drop. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We`ve stopped drug flights out of Colombia he told me but not from places we don`t control.  
 
WALSH:  He means Venezuela, just five miles away.  Below they think they`ve spotted a cocaine laboratory one of many fueling Venezuela`s role as a 
 
 cocaine courier.  Which a CNN investigation has learned is booming just as the country collapses, 240 tons went from Colombia to Venezuela in 2018.  
 
 After a third (ph) in one year, a U.S. official told us which could fetch $40 billion on U.S. streets.  That traffic happening down below, one 
 
 possible (inaudible) why do many in the Venezuelan army and government never (inaudible) give up on Nicolas Maduro . They`re simply making too 
 
 much money. 
 
The trade remains mostly secret inside Venezuela on the other side of the border here but we were able to learn more about these illegal routes in 
 
 from recent defectors from the Venezuelan army border patrol.  And about how their officers ordered them to let cross specific trucks carrying 
 
 cocaine.  For five years this sergeant got those orders often three times a week.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE TRANSLATED:  The cars that cross both weapons and drugs were pick ups and we would be told the color and make of the truck and 
 
 when, usually just after dawn or dusk.  Everything was coordinated by the brigade commander.  He`d send a lieutenant to tell you what needed to cross 
 
 and this was arranged high up above.  Those who didn`t agree were swapped out automatically.  
 
WALSH:  He fled to here, Colombia when the pressure to comply got too much and his unit found themselves confined to base.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE TRANSLATED:  We were locked on the base.  The general would say, everyone must be with us.  Leave or speak against the 
 
 government, you`ll get arrested.  They had us brainwashed with food handouts.  One night I couldn`t take it anymore.  I went home and told my 
 
 wife, we leave for Colombia.  My son started crying and said, Dad what are we going to do?  But I knew if they stayed without me they`d be captured or 
 
 interrogated.  
 
WALSH:  Venezuelan state TV occasionally shows how their armed forces crack down on the trade here intersecting Mexican pilots that have previously 
 
 rejected allegations their actually running the drugs.  And then they`ll respond to several requests for comment.  But a U.S. official has told CNN 
 
 these flights are surging, they use to take off from the remote hidden runways in the southern Venezuelan jungle but in the last three years moved 
 
 north a U.S. official told CNN to reduce flying time.  There used to be three a week but last year there were almost daily.  This year, they`ve 
 
 seen as many as eight in a single day a regional official said using 50 hidden runways.  
 
CNN has seen a confidential U.S. radar map approximately here that shows the sharp turn left of planes from Venezuela take before landing on the 
 
 remote Central American coast line off of Honduras before the cocaine travels north through Mexico to the United States.  Honduras is where we 
 
 pick up the trail of this booming traffic again on the coastline below turned into a surreal graveyard of narco planes.  Cocaine cargo they carry 
 
 is worth so many millions the plane itself is just a fraction in a billion dollar deal.  So, many are discarded (inaudible) all over the jungle or 
 
 crammed here into one river bend. 
 
The troops we`re with don`t want to be on camera for their safety.  Some of these have their markings torn off to make the job of working exactly where 
 
 they come from even harder.  America`s drug habit is where the money, the route (ph), all begins.  But that same open market also supplies a key part 
 
 of the logistics here.  When the fires deprived most of this plane of kind of distinguishing characteristics but you can still see N4 there.  N 
 
 meaning this plane originated in the United States.  Brokers, a U.S. official tells me, buy up dozens of old planes at auction in the United 
 
 States and hide their ownership in shell companies to send them south to start the cocaine journey north from Venezuela. 
 
Again, another N, which means another plane that started its days in the United States.  It`s not just traffickers in Venezuela and the U.S. making 
 
 billions, the entire region is in on it.  This is surely Honduras` biggest industry, the billions at stake everywhere.  From this jungle road which is 
 
 actually a hidden runway up to the Honduran president`s brother indicted last year on trafficking charges which he denies.  You can`t stop the 
 
 planes being sold or taking off one officer tells me.  So they instead just have to try and make landing harder by blowing holes in the runways.  Just 
 
 in slowing down this multibillion dollar trade requires so many more holes to be blown in this vast expanse of jungle. 
 
The amounts of money cocaine brings here literally dwarfs any effort to fight it.  Insane amounts of cash and to some villages along this coastline 
 
 that have none.  In fact, the Honduran army tells us traffickers flying towards these villages often kick their cargo overboard when they think 
 
 they`re about to be intercepted.  Each 30 kilogram bundle of cocaine is attached to floats and then drifts ashore.  They then pay these communities 
 
 of fishermen $150,000 for each recovered bundle.  It`s calculus for corruption that most officials I spoke to admit they (inaudible) and that 
 
 no police or aid operation can really hope to challenge. 
 
One that sees the collapsing Maduro government has the alleged couriers cashing in  fast in a region of desperate (inaudible). 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)   
 
AZUZ:  At first this will look like your run of the mill pontoon boat hanging out on a lake.  Nothing really unusual here until we zoom out and 
 
 now you see the problem.  There was no one aboard the boat.  No lives were threatened here.  Officials believe that recent severe storms in the area 
 
 caused the boat to break loose and drift to the edge of a dam.  Once the weather calmed down, wildlife officers used an electric wench to pull the 
 
 boat back to shore. 
 
All hands on deck to stop a &amp;quot;shipwreck&amp;quot;, to keep the &amp;quot;boat afloat&amp;quot;, a &amp;quot;tact to stay intact&amp;quot;.  For &amp;quot;bow to stern&amp;quot; and from &amp;quot;port to starboard&amp;quot; it still 
 
 &amp;quot;seaworthy&amp;quot; of being &amp;quot;safely harbored&amp;quot;.  It was &amp;quot;on the edge&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hanging out&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;in it deep&amp;quot;.  One &amp;quot;waterfall&amp;quot; away from being &amp;quot;posidenseat&amp;quot; but 
 
 thanks to some &amp;quot;maritime magic&amp;quot; in  a pinch she &amp;quot;sails&amp;quot; again &amp;quot;tugged&amp;quot; away by a &amp;quot;wench&amp;quot;.  I`m your &amp;quot;anchor&amp;quot; Carl Azuz taking a &amp;quot;bow&amp;quot; for CNN.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  With the fire out in Notre Dame, French officials and historians are combing through the cathedral to take stock of 
 
 what`s left.  There was a lot saved.  The two towers and facade at the front, what many people envision when they think of Notre Dame, they`re 
 
 still standing.  A Paris city hall spokesperson says the cathedrals most significant treasures were saved including what Notre Dame calls its most 
 
 precious and venerated relic.  A crown of thorns which many believe is the crown of thorns that was placed on the head of Jesus Christ.
 
The chaplain of the Paris fire service is being called a hero for rescuing that and other artifacts and the cathedrals great organ is safe.  Scores of 
 
 the relics that survived were taken to the Louvre Museum, what was lost the cathedral`s spire, large parts of its roof and it`s ancient vaulted 
 
 ceiling.  The central part of the building was damaged.  The Paris Fire Brigade says it`s not known yet what caused the fire.  A French government 
 
 spokesman says it could be months before the full scope of the damage is known and a restoration expert expects it will take 10 to 15 years to fully 
 
 rebuild Notre Dame. 
 
The Vatican has offered its technical expertise in restoring the medieval catholic church and as far as funding goes, French philanthropists and 
 
 businesses have pledged more than $700 million in donations to restore the cathedral.  That gives you one sense about what Notre Dame means to France.  
 
 Here`s another.  Victor Hugo`s novel, &amp;quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&amp;quot; became the best selling book on Amazon France shortly after the fire took place.  
 
 A different edition of the same novel was the second best selling book, for a third sense of the building`s significance here`s CNN`s Phil Black. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  How do you measure the profound value of one old building to a nation or to the world?  Perhaps when people stop in 
 
 the street to weep and pray because of its partial destruction, when the French president openly shares that grief. 
 
FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON:  (untranslated)
 
BLACK:  And efforts to save it are broadcast everywhere.  Notre Dame is among the most famous of famous buildings, 13 million people visit it every 
 
 year.  Countless more stand before it, tilt their heads up and gaze at the extraordinary vertical scale. The vast rose windows and the many ornate 
 
 sculptures guarding its exterior.  Gargoyles, saints and angels, all the features that make it a masterpiece of the Gothic style but few visitors 
 
 saw this. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (untranslated)
 
BLACK:  A 2018 special broadcast by local network France Deux (ph) showed these images, the centuries old woodwork supporting the roof.  There`s so 
 
 much oak here its known as the forest of Notre Dame.  The same timber structures that would just a few months later feed a fire that threatened 
 
 to destroy the whole cathedral.  Notre Dame, Our Lady of Paris has stood since the 1200s`.  A building in constant evolution as artists and 
 
 craftsmen altered and repaired the structure and its decorations.  The towering timber spire now a loss to the flames was added in the 1800s`.  
 
Often a symbol and reflection of French political power, the cathedral was vandalized through the French Revolution while Napoleon Bonaparte used it 
 
 to reinstate monarchic rule with his coronation as Emperor.  Later, French Republican leaders, the nations presidents were honored here too.  This 
 
 service was for military hero and statesman Charles de Gaulle.  Notre Dame survived the violence and the occupation of war.  More recently terrorist 
 
 attacks in Paris saw it become a focus for the nations grief. 
 
An inspiration for artists across many art forms, none more important than Victor Hugo`s novel published in English as &amp;quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&amp;quot;.  
 
 Before the flames, time and weather were the cathedrals determined and powerful enemies.  Desperately needed restoration work was already 
 
 underway.  Now saving Notre Dame has become a critical goal for all of France.  In a place famed for beautiful, old buildings one stood above all 
 
 others as an icon of the nation`s story and the French people are not ready to let it go. Phil Black, CNN, London.

AZUZ:  The next U.S. presidential election is more than a year and a half away so why would we address it this far out?  Because 20 candidates 
 
 already have.  U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has filed his reelection paperwork.  He did it the day he was sworn into the presidency.  
 
 In recent months, one Republican and 18 Democrats have officially announced they`re challenging President Trump for the job and there are several other 
 
 Democrats who are thinking about joining the race.  This all culminates in the presidential election on November 3rd, 2020 and along the way voters, 
 
 events, travel and a lot of money all come into play.
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You want to run for president.  Being president makes you the single most powerful person, man or woman, in the world but it`s 
 
 also a multiyear commitment that forces you to give up your personal life and any since of privacy.  And then about half the country`s going to hate 
 
 you no matter what you do.  The Constitution has only three requirements, natural born citizen, at least 35 years old, 14 years residing in the 
 
 United States but there`s so much more to it.  First, there`s the primary process.  Since only Republicans or Democrats are seen as serious 
 
 candidates you have to choose a party and get popular in that party.
 
An inspirational biography helps.  Maybe some years as governor or Senator, although even a few mayors think they`re ready this year and a Congressman 
 
 who lost a Senate race.  Might now matter since the current president had zero government experience when he ran.  You spend nearly a year bouncing 
 
 back and forth from Iowa to New Hampshire to South Carolina to Nevada.  If you`re not with voters, you`re raising money and raising money and raising 
 
 money.  It takes millions to mount a serious bid and you can only raise $2,700 per donor for the primary and $2,700 per donor for the general 
 
 election.  If you get that far. 
 
Hillary Clinton raised and spent almost $1 billion losing to Donald Trump.  He raised much less.  The primaries are expensive too.  Bernie Sanders 
 
 spent $222 million on his 2016 primary loss.  Why is it so expensive?  You`ve got to have an army of staffers and volunteers.  You have to buy TV 
 
 ads, internet ads.  In the general election, you`re going to spend every waking hour in Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, maybe Ohio, Colorado.  
 
If you want to win, you should probably visit Wisconsin.  There are debates and town halls and interview after interview after interview.  And then if 
 
 you win, you get to be president.  It means you live above the office.  You get to try to work with Congress to get something done.  Oh, and you`re 
 
 going to have to start running for reelection on day one.

AZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Before the U.S. Air Force became an independent branch of the military, under which branch was it organized?  Army, Navy, 
 
 Coast Guard, or Marines Corps.  The U.S. Air Force started as the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army`s Signal Corps.

AZUZ:  Dubai United Arab Emirates is a desert so there`s not much rain but when there is and its accompanied by thunder, the Birds Khalifa the world`s 
 
 tallest building becomes a lightening rod.  The massive jolts of electricity were diverted down to earth.  Nobody was hurt but plenty of 
 
 people shared video and pictures including Dubai`s Crown Prince.  
 
It`s not just &amp;quot;lightful&amp;quot;.  It`s &amp;quot;delightful&amp;quot;.  An illuminating jolt that brings both &amp;quot;felicity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;electricity&amp;quot;.   It &amp;quot;sparks&amp;quot; conversation and 
 
 concern.  It draws both a crowd and a &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot;.   It`s a &amp;quot;power trip&amp;quot; that trips &amp;quot;power transforming transformers&amp;quot; and bring a &amp;quot;shock&amp;quot; to all who see 
 
 it.  I`m Carl Azuz, &amp;quot;lighting&amp;quot; up another edition of CNN 10.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  A new week of CNN 10 starts right now.  I`m Carl Azuz, explaining events from around the world.  Thank you for taking 10 
 
 minutes to watch.  A massive storm system welled up last week in the United States.  A nation that consistently has the most violent weather in the 
 
 world.  When we put this show together, there were 90 million people, more than a quarter of the entire U.S. population who were under the threat of 
 
 destructive weather.  In Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, at least five people were killed as the system swept across the south on Saturday and 
 
 Sunday.  
 
A tornado was spotted in southeast Alabama Sunday morning and that wasn`t the only threat.  A CNN meteorologist said the storms also carried damaging 
 
 winds and hail.  The National Weather Service warned people in the path that torrential rains could cause flash flooding in some areas.  Monroe 
 
 County, in northeast Mississippi, was hit particularly hard according to its sheriff.  He said the area was a mess after homes, businesses and a 
 
 fire station were destroyed.  
 
There was also a lot of flooding there and two states east in Georgia, tee times were scheduled earlier for The Masters golf tournament on Sunday 
 
 because heavy storms were expected to pass through later that night.  In fact, a tornado watch was issued for the city of Augusta, as well as parts 
 
 of South Carolina Sunday night.  Knowing the difference between a watch and a warning can help you know what action you should take.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When severe weather strikes, one of the most common questions we get, what`s the difference between a watch and a warning?  
 
 Well just for comparison sake let`s take this stoplight, green light, yellow light, red light.  Sometimes the National Weather Service will issue 
 
 a hazardous weather outlook, an advisory, treat this as a green light.  Know that the possibility that rough weather is there but go about your day 
 
 as you would just stay alert.  But as conditions tend to ripen, we may see a tornado watch issued by the National Weather Service. 
 
Use this with more caution.  This means conditions are favorable for tornado development and so you need to know what you should do in case a 
 
 tornado strikes.  That`s where the warning comes in.  If the radar has indicated a tornado or someone has spotted a tornado in progress, that`s 
 
 when the tornado warning is issued and you should get to your safe place immediately.  Stop what you`re doing and seek shelter.

AZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Where would you most likely find regolith?  Off Iceland`s coast, In Earth`s core, On the moon or On Jupiter`s surface.  
 
 Regolith is a loose rocky covering of a planet`s surface.  Scientists say Jupiter has no firm surface so the answer here is the moon. 
 
It launched into space in February and circled the earth several times before being sling shotted away.  It traveled a total of four million miles 
 
 and finally reached the moon but not in the way Israeli scientists hoped it would.  Their unmanned privately funded spacecraft was supposed to make a 
 
 soft controlled landing there but communication was lost when it was about 500 feet away from the moon`s surface, and it was traveling toward it at 
 
 310 miles per hour.  So, well, boom.  If it had been successful, this would have been the first time a private organization made a controlled landing 
 
 with the smallest budget.  Still the team and their nation`s leader have suggested this isn`t the end. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There were high hopes and high drama and in the end high disappointment for the people behind this ambitious 
 
 privately funded $100 million project.  From the beginning, it was the case of the little guy shooting for the moon or more precisely a soft landing on 
 
 the moon and they nearly made it with their spacecraft Beresheet which means Genesis.  There was a crowd that included the Prime Minister Benjamin 
 
 Netanyahu watching on but the team lost contact with the spacecraft in the last moments before the planned touchdown.  
 
Apparently engine problems and then the descent became uncontrollable and it crashed.  In a moment of classic understatement, one of the project 
 
 managers saying, I`m sorry to say but our spacecraft did not make it in one piece to the moon.  If they had, Israel would have been just the fourth 
 
 country to soft land on the moon after the old Soviet Union, the U.S. and China.  Still though, a major achievement for an upstart group that began 
 
 eight years ago as part of a Google competition.
 
 They didn`t make the deadline for that competition but decided to keep going with private funding and a lot of good old chutzpah and they came oh 
 
 so close to success.  Still became only the seventh country to get to the moon if not successfully land on it.  A lot of pride in Israel in this 
 
 project.  Plenty of people watching live including school kids at the president`s home and those behind the project not letting the less than 
 
 soft landing put them off.  For its part SpaceIL says quote, &amp;quot;Don`t stop believing.  We will continue to work hard.&amp;quot;  And then the Prime Minister 
 
 Netanyahu saying quote, &amp;quot; We will try again.  Next time it will be better.&amp;quot;  A sign perhaps of government involvement going forward quote, &amp;quot;I`m 
 
 seriously considering investing now in the space program.&amp;quot;  Michael Holmes, CNN, Jerusalem.

AZUZ:  Space investors from around the world will probably have a new option for getting their satellites into orbit.  It`s called Stratolaunch 
 
 and its considered to be a mega jet.  Six engines, two cockpits though only one is used to fly it.  Its wing span is 385 feet which is wider than an 
 
 American football field is long.  This plane is longer, wider and heavier than the H-4 Hercules, also known as the Spruce Goose.  And the 
 
 Stratolaunch made history Saturday morning when it lifted off the ground, got up to speeds of 173 miles per hour and climbed 15,000 feet into the 
 
 sky. 
 
But you and I aren`t going to fly it as passengers.  This thing`s designed to carry rockets loaded with satellites so they can be launched from an 
 
 altitude of 35,000 feet into orbit.  That can save money over ground based launches.  Stratolaunch was funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen who 
 
 died last October.  It does have competitions from other companies and it has a series of test flights and certifications to go through before it can 
 
 actually start working. 
 
There are an estimated 1.3 million people in America who are classified as unaccompanied youths.  One of them lost his mother when he was 12.  His 
 
 father was incarcerated when he was 13 and he didn`t have anywhere to live.  That`s a problem that Vicki Sokolik has been working to solve since 2007 
 
 when she founded Starting Right Now.  It`s an organization that`s helped more than 200 young people in Tampa Florida.

VICKI SOKOLIK:  A homeless, unaccompanied youth is about 15 to 19 years old who is not with their parents or guardian and not eligible for foster care 
 
 because they weren`t taken from their home but rather they made the decision to leave their dangerous situation.  Most people don`t even know 
 
 these kids exist.  There`s a lot of shame that goes with being a homeless unaccompanied youth.  They hide what`s actually going on with them and so 
 
 they really become this very invisible population.
 
Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  
 
We have helped 200 unaccompanied homeless youth.  Our kids were just dealt bad hands and we help them reshuffle their deck.  
 
Do you want a pescate?  No.  Just banana bread? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  
 
SOKOLIK:  We offer safe and stable housing, academic support, a reliable mentor in their life and all with the goal of getting each student to reach 
 
 their own full potential.  We went to great lengths to build houses to make them really feel like homes.  A lot of times, it`s a first time they 
 
 actually have a bed that they can call their own.  We look at every single student as an individual person.  If a student needs extreme academic 
 
 support?  That`s what we`re going to focus on.  If a student needs extreme therapy?  That`s what we`re going to focus on and then we help them plan 
 
 their future. 
 
OK.  So you`re still planning on going to SPC. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  
 
SOKOLIK:  97 percent of our kids graduate high school and go on to their next goal.  The transformation of these kids is monumental.  They come in 
 
 so broken.  They cannot trust and I`m just one person telling them I`m going to help them.  They become softer.  It`s just great that they can be 
 
 happy and they`re be able to be kids again.  These are kids who have been told they don`t matter and their voice does matter.

AZUZ:  Airports and waterfalls seem like two things that don`t really go together but they do at Singapore`s Changi Airport.  In its new $1.3 
 
 billion shopping complex, Changi has added an indoor forest complete with an indoor waterfall.  Its more than 130 feet high making it the tallest 
 
 indoor waterfall on the planet and what better place to put it than the airport that`s been ranked the best in the world.
 
Who needs a runway when you can have a &amp;quot;spillway&amp;quot;?  Who needs a layover when you can have a &amp;quot;spray over&amp;quot;?  In the &amp;quot;concourse&amp;quot; of travel, when 
 
 people get &amp;quot;hangered&amp;quot; up by delays that seem &amp;quot;interminable&amp;quot; it`s great to have a tower of water if the tower of control gets backed up.  Maybe Changi 
 
 will become a destination of its own for some folks who just don`t want to &amp;quot;departure&amp;quot;.  This is your captain Carl Azuz landing another edition of 
 
 CNN.
