CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Welcome to a special edition of CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.  
 
Today, we`re taking a look at inside the U.S. food supply, this time, zeroing in on produce.  We`re examining how engineering and importing have 
 
 replaced old fashion growing in the U.S. food industry, and how consumer demand still has the power to influence the industry.  
 
Our reporter Cristina Alesci has gone inside some of America`s biggest food companies, seeing what most folks haven`t seen before and getting 
 
 incredible insight as to how production affects what`s on our plate.
 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 
CRISTINA ALESCI, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Salad.  Americans are eating up to five times more leafy greens than they did 20 years ago.  
 
 We`re consuming three billion pounds a year.  But our intensifying love affair with fresh produce is creating problems for farmers, for the 
 
 environment, and even for our own health.  
 
One in six Americans, that`s 48 million people, get sick from contaminated food each year, 3,000 die.  That you think it`s coming from undercooked 
 
 meat and fish.  Well, produce is actually responsible for about half of the illnesses.  
 
MANSOUR SAMADPOUR, PHD, PRESIDENT, IEH LABORATORIES:  Any industry that wants to produce safe foods, they can do that.  
 
ALESCI:  Dr. Mansour Samadpour runs one of the nation`s largest food safety consulting labs.  Chipotle recently hired his company to assess and improve 
 
 safety standards after the government traced an outbreak of E. coli back to some of its stores.  He stocks listeria and salmonella in his office.  
 
SAMADPOUR:  This plate in theory is good enough to infect everyone in the city of Seattle.
 
ALESCI (on camera):  How could you get so close to it?  
 
SAMADPOUR:  Because they don`t jump.  
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Recently, the risk associated with some fruits and vegetables has become so high that the FDA begun actively monitoring them 
 
 for contaminants, a historic move for the agency.
 
So, how serious is the industry when it comes to keeping our food safe?
 
We traveled across the country to find out.  
 
It`s sunrise in Salinas Valley, California.  This area is called the &amp;quot;Salad Bowl of America&amp;quot; and for good reason.  Its fields produce 60 percent of the 
 
 leafy greens in the U.S.  
 
DIRK GIANNINI, FARMER:  I think farmers are the backbone of this nation, to be honest.
 
ALESCI (on camera):  I climb up on this side, right?
 
So, this is water that did this, that cut this?
 
GIANNINI:  Yes, it`s a water knife with extreme amount of pressure.  We`re trying to attract better workers and a better working environment for our 
 
 employees.
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Dirk`s family has been farming this land for four generations.
 
GIANNINI:  The amount of work that goes behind one head of lettuce is tremendous and the basic consumer has no idea of the intensity and the 
 
 dedication to a 10-acre block of romaine.
 
ALESCI:  Farming in this part of the world has gotten really rough.  Farmers are fighting a drought, a labor shortage and rising prices for 
 
 land, even some insiders say the industrial process is pushed to the brink.  
 
The president of Campbell`s Fresh is one of them.
 
(on camera):  What is the state of the food system?
 
JEFF DUNN, PRESIDENT, CAMPBELL`S FRESH:  I would say that it`s highly stressed.  The past 50 years of over-farming a lot of land has created real 
 
 problems on the global basis in terms of having enough irrigable farmland.  The word I`ve used is stressed almost from any dimension you look at.
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  And farming is just the beginning of the process.  And yes, I mean, process.
 
(on camera):  How cold is it in there?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It`s going to be about 34 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit in there.  The entire process is that cold.  
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Taylor Farms is the largest producer of fresh cut vegetables in the world.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Any given day, we`re going to have a million pounds of product come through this cooler.
 
ALESCI (on camera):  A million pound?
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A million pound of products.
 
ALESCI:  Wow.
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whether we dice, shred or shock, they`re going through several series of cutters and they immediately fall down into the beginning 
 
 of our wash process.
 
BRUCE TAYLOR, FOUNDER AND CEO, TAYLOR FARMS:  It kills Gram-negative bacteria, which is the bad stuff.  So, E. coli, salmonella and listeria.
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Taylor spent millions on the so-called smart wash system after spinach from another California company caused 200 people to 
 
 get sick and killed three.
 
TAYLOR:  You can`t eliminate -- there`s no kill stuff in our industry yet.  It`s still fresh products, so you can`t cook it or microwave it, or to do 
 
 something like that.
 
ALESCI (on camera):  How much of a setback was the outbreak in 2006 of E. coli?
 
GIANNINI:  I think that was a wake up call. 
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  Beyond the human costs, it was a $300 million setback to the industry.
 
SAMADPOUR:  The current assumption is that the food is safe until proven otherwise.  We have made a lot of people sick over the years.  
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  You may be asking, how does a bacteria like E. coli or salmonella end up in your leafy greens?  It could be a variety of ways, 
 
 but the most common answer is waste.  
 
Manure is used to fertilize crops.  Animals like rodents or birds pick up the bacteria and then carry it into produce fields.  
 
SAMADPOUR:  People really need to understand what they are eating, where it has been grown.  You`re planning to travel to a country and they say, when 
 
 you go there, don`t eat salads and don`t drink water.  And then you find out that your salad is coming from that place.  
 
ALESCI:  And an appetite for year-round produce means the imports just keep coming.
 
TOM NASSIF, PRESIDENT AND CEO, WESTERN GROWERS:  Well, they always produces, but it wasn`t the kind of importing that`s being done now.  Every 
 
 year, we import more and more fresh produce from foreign countries.  We found that in many of the outbreaks, it comes from foreign producers.
 
ALESCI:  The government is trying to hold foreign producers to a higher standard, with the Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA -- the most 
 
 significant food safety law in 70 years.  The bill sets guidelines for how companies should prevent and respond to contamination.  
 
It sounds great.  The problem: funding.
 
(on camera):  How much more does the FDA really need to do its job right?
 
SAMADPOUR:  Much more than what they have been asking for.
 
ALESCI:  How much more?
 
SAMADPOUR:  Say they need probably minimum 10 times more resources, 10 times more resources.
 
ALESCI (voice-over):  The agency says it needs about $170 million more.  A lack of money and people might be one of the reasons the FDA has stopped 
 
 short of requiring routine government inspections of farms, according to critics.  Instead, it relies on third party auditors.  But the agency says 
 
 the new law gives the industry an accountability that didn`t exist before.  The goal it says is getting safer food to you.  
 
But with 48 million people getting sick each year, and an estimated $77 billion in costs, the price of failure is high.
 
(on camera):  Fresh food, it`s what everyone wants to eat more of, and the key to the healthy diet.  And technically, it`s supposed to make shopping 
 
 more simple.  There isn`t a laundry list of ingredients on a bag of carrots, right?  
 
But sometimes, shopping for raw ingredients could actually be more confusing than buying the packaged and processed stuff.  So, let me bring 
 
 it down for you.
 
(voice-over):  After reporting &amp;quot;Raw Ingredients&amp;quot;, people said, great, now that you`ve scared us, what can we buy that`s safe in the grocery story?  
 
 Should you buy organic produce?
 
Well, it kind of depends.  The government tracks chemical residues on our fruits and vegetables.  The worst culprits: apples, berries, cucumbers and 
 
 spinach.  It might be worth paying a premium for those.  
 
Or you could stick to fruits and vegetables that have fewer chemical deposits.  Think onions, sweet corn, cabbage and eggplant.  The cleanest: 
 
 avocados.
 
There is an emerging alternative, hydroponics, growing produce without soil, which is supposed to be much cleaner than an open field.
 
(on camera):  Fish, you want it low in contaminants and high in omega 3s, the good fatty acids.  
 
(voice-over):  Seafood like mackerel, shrimp and wild salmon.
 
Or look for pull caught fish.  Those tend to be younger, so they spent less time exposed to toxins. 
 
(on camera):  But what if your local store only stocks farm-raised salmon?
 
(voice-over):  Those can be higher in industrial chemicals stored in fish bag.  But experts say you can remove most of the bad stuff like trimming 
 
 away or cooking off the fat.
 
(on camera):  But enough with the veggies and fish, how about the meat?  Now, the ideal here is, find some companies that minimize antibiotics.
 
(voice-over):  The CDC says that all those drugs in our meat have created a public health threat known as a super bug.  So, look for these labels.  
 
 These third parties are supposed to ensure farmers are using drugs responsibly.
 
And here are a few marketing scams you should watch out for.  Terms like &amp;quot;natural and farm raised&amp;quot;.  Those don`t tell customers whether living 
 
 conditions for the animals are horrendous or pristine.
 
And while &amp;quot;hormone free&amp;quot; chicken sounds great, the FDA bans those in chickens, turkeys and hogs.
 
(on camera):  Bottom line: eat fresh food, just ask a few more questions.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Welcome to a new edition of CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.  Happy to see you this Thursday.  There is some news expected out of 
 
 Washington, DC today.  It concerns the Mueller Report, the special investigation by former FBI Director Robert Mueller.  It looked into 
 
 alleged Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election of 2016.  The Justice Department already released a summary of the report to 
 
 Congress, that happened last month.  It said the investigation did not find that the campaign of Donald Trump illegally conspired or coordinated with 
 
 Russia.  The Mueller Report didn`t draw a conclusion about whether President Trump obstructed justice, if he illegally interfered with 
 
 government work. 
 
But the summary said the U.S. Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General both concluded that there wasn`t sufficient evidence that the president had 
 
 done anything wrong.  So what`s happening today?  Well Democrats said the four page summary wasn`t enough.  They wanted to see the entire Mueller 
 
 Report of more than 300 pages.  That`s expected to be released today, though it`s also expected to be redacted meaning parts of it will likely be 
 
 edited or removed first.  CNN 10 is planning to follow up on this story next week. 
 
10 Second Trivia.  Which of these countries won its independence from Spain in 1811?  Brazil, Haiti, Venezuela, or Jamaica.  Only one of these 
 
 countries that won its independence from Spain is Venezuela.  
 
Venezuela`s leader is starting to let humanitarian aid into the country.  For years, President Nicolas Maduro has denied that there`s a crisis in 
 
 Venezuela but this week his government allowed the Red Cross to make its first delivery there.  The United Nations estimates that more than 20 
 
 percent of Venezuelans are in desperate need of supplies like medicine.  With its economy in shambles, a CNN investigation just found that illegal 
 
 drug trafficking through Venezuela is soaring.  The country accuses the U.S. and Colombia of trying to distract attention toward Venezuela to hide 
 
 their own defeat in the war on drugs.  But Nick Paton Walsh found first hand how Venezuela is becoming a major currier of cocaine. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Below is a cocaine super highway enriching Venezuela`s corrupt elite by (ph) bringing 
 
 coke to American streets.  These thin lines are secret pathways from Colombia`s cocaine farming heartland below, across into neighboring 
 
 Venezuela.  From there billions of dollars of the drug are smuggled north in tiny planes, U.S. and regional officials told CNN aided by Venezuela`s 
 
 army and elite.  The Colombian military we`re with don`t get any lower to stay out of the range of track (ph) and machine guns and talk to locals 
 
 mostly through the leaflets they drop. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We`ve stopped drug flights out of Colombia he told me but not from places we don`t control.  
 
WALSH:  He means Venezuela, just five miles away.  Below they think they`ve spotted a cocaine laboratory one of many fueling Venezuela`s role as a 
 
 cocaine courier.  Which a CNN investigation has learned is booming just as the country collapses, 240 tons went from Colombia to Venezuela in 2018.  
 
 After a third (ph) in one year, a U.S. official told us which could fetch $40 billion on U.S. streets.  That traffic happening down below, one 
 
 possible (inaudible) why do many in the Venezuelan army and government never (inaudible) give up on Nicolas Maduro . They`re simply making too 
 
 much money. 
 
The trade remains mostly secret inside Venezuela on the other side of the border here but we were able to learn more about these illegal routes in 
 
 from recent defectors from the Venezuelan army border patrol.  And about how their officers ordered them to let cross specific trucks carrying 
 
 cocaine.  For five years this sergeant got those orders often three times a week.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE TRANSLATED:  The cars that cross both weapons and drugs were pick ups and we would be told the color and make of the truck and 
 
 when, usually just after dawn or dusk.  Everything was coordinated by the brigade commander.  He`d send a lieutenant to tell you what needed to cross 
 
 and this was arranged high up above.  Those who didn`t agree were swapped out automatically.  
 
WALSH:  He fled to here, Colombia when the pressure to comply got too much and his unit found themselves confined to base.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE TRANSLATED:  We were locked on the base.  The general would say, everyone must be with us.  Leave or speak against the 
 
 government, you`ll get arrested.  They had us brainwashed with food handouts.  One night I couldn`t take it anymore.  I went home and told my 
 
 wife, we leave for Colombia.  My son started crying and said, Dad what are we going to do?  But I knew if they stayed without me they`d be captured or 
 
 interrogated.  
 
WALSH:  Venezuelan state TV occasionally shows how their armed forces crack down on the trade here intersecting Mexican pilots that have previously 
 
 rejected allegations their actually running the drugs.  And then they`ll respond to several requests for comment.  But a U.S. official has told CNN 
 
 these flights are surging, they use to take off from the remote hidden runways in the southern Venezuelan jungle but in the last three years moved 
 
 north a U.S. official told CNN to reduce flying time.  There used to be three a week but last year there were almost daily.  This year, they`ve 
 
 seen as many as eight in a single day a regional official said using 50 hidden runways.  
 
CNN has seen a confidential U.S. radar map approximately here that shows the sharp turn left of planes from Venezuela take before landing on the 
 
 remote Central American coast line off of Honduras before the cocaine travels north through Mexico to the United States.  Honduras is where we 
 
 pick up the trail of this booming traffic again on the coastline below turned into a surreal graveyard of narco planes.  Cocaine cargo they carry 
 
 is worth so many millions the plane itself is just a fraction in a billion dollar deal.  So, many are discarded (inaudible) all over the jungle or 
 
 crammed here into one river bend. 
 
The troops we`re with don`t want to be on camera for their safety.  Some of these have their markings torn off to make the job of working exactly where 
 
 they come from even harder.  America`s drug habit is where the money, the route (ph), all begins.  But that same open market also supplies a key part 
 
 of the logistics here.  When the fires deprived most of this plane of kind of distinguishing characteristics but you can still see N4 there.  N 
 
 meaning this plane originated in the United States.  Brokers, a U.S. official tells me, buy up dozens of old planes at auction in the United 
 
 States and hide their ownership in shell companies to send them south to start the cocaine journey north from Venezuela. 
 
Again, another N, which means another plane that started its days in the United States.  It`s not just traffickers in Venezuela and the U.S. making 
 
 billions, the entire region is in on it.  This is surely Honduras` biggest industry, the billions at stake everywhere.  From this jungle road which is 
 
 actually a hidden runway up to the Honduran president`s brother indicted last year on trafficking charges which he denies.  You can`t stop the 
 
 planes being sold or taking off one officer tells me.  So they instead just have to try and make landing harder by blowing holes in the runways.  Just 
 
 in slowing down this multibillion dollar trade requires so many more holes to be blown in this vast expanse of jungle. 
 
The amounts of money cocaine brings here literally dwarfs any effort to fight it.  Insane amounts of cash and to some villages along this coastline 
 
 that have none.  In fact, the Honduran army tells us traffickers flying towards these villages often kick their cargo overboard when they think 
 
 they`re about to be intercepted.  Each 30 kilogram bundle of cocaine is attached to floats and then drifts ashore.  They then pay these communities 
 
 of fishermen $150,000 for each recovered bundle.  It`s calculus for corruption that most officials I spoke to admit they (inaudible) and that 
 
 no police or aid operation can really hope to challenge. 
 
One that sees the collapsing Maduro government has the alleged couriers cashing in  fast in a region of desperate (inaudible). 
 
(END VIDEO CLIP)   
 
AZUZ:  At first this will look like your run of the mill pontoon boat hanging out on a lake.  Nothing really unusual here until we zoom out and 
 
 now you see the problem.  There was no one aboard the boat.  No lives were threatened here.  Officials believe that recent severe storms in the area 
 
 caused the boat to break loose and drift to the edge of a dam.  Once the weather calmed down, wildlife officers used an electric wench to pull the 
 
 boat back to shore. 
 
All hands on deck to stop a &amp;quot;shipwreck&amp;quot;, to keep the &amp;quot;boat afloat&amp;quot;, a &amp;quot;tact to stay intact&amp;quot;.  For &amp;quot;bow to stern&amp;quot; and from &amp;quot;port to starboard&amp;quot; it still 
 
 &amp;quot;seaworthy&amp;quot; of being &amp;quot;safely harbored&amp;quot;.  It was &amp;quot;on the edge&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hanging out&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;in it deep&amp;quot;.  One &amp;quot;waterfall&amp;quot; away from being &amp;quot;posidenseat&amp;quot; but 
 
 thanks to some &amp;quot;maritime magic&amp;quot; in  a pinch she &amp;quot;sails&amp;quot; again &amp;quot;tugged&amp;quot; away by a &amp;quot;wench&amp;quot;.  I`m your &amp;quot;anchor&amp;quot; Carl Azuz taking a &amp;quot;bow&amp;quot; for CNN.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  With the fire out in Notre Dame, French officials and historians are combing through the cathedral to take stock of 
 
 what`s left.  There was a lot saved.  The two towers and facade at the front, what many people envision when they think of Notre Dame, they`re 
 
 still standing.  A Paris city hall spokesperson says the cathedrals most significant treasures were saved including what Notre Dame calls its most 
 
 precious and venerated relic.  A crown of thorns which many believe is the crown of thorns that was placed on the head of Jesus Christ.
 
The chaplain of the Paris fire service is being called a hero for rescuing that and other artifacts and the cathedrals great organ is safe.  Scores of 
 
 the relics that survived were taken to the Louvre Museum, what was lost the cathedral`s spire, large parts of its roof and it`s ancient vaulted 
 
 ceiling.  The central part of the building was damaged.  The Paris Fire Brigade says it`s not known yet what caused the fire.  A French government 
 
 spokesman says it could be months before the full scope of the damage is known and a restoration expert expects it will take 10 to 15 years to fully 
 
 rebuild Notre Dame. 
 
The Vatican has offered its technical expertise in restoring the medieval catholic church and as far as funding goes, French philanthropists and 
 
 businesses have pledged more than $700 million in donations to restore the cathedral.  That gives you one sense about what Notre Dame means to France.  
 
 Here`s another.  Victor Hugo`s novel, &amp;quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&amp;quot; became the best selling book on Amazon France shortly after the fire took place.  
 
 A different edition of the same novel was the second best selling book, for a third sense of the building`s significance here`s CNN`s Phil Black. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  How do you measure the profound value of one old building to a nation or to the world?  Perhaps when people stop in 
 
 the street to weep and pray because of its partial destruction, when the French president openly shares that grief. 
 
FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON:  (untranslated)
 
BLACK:  And efforts to save it are broadcast everywhere.  Notre Dame is among the most famous of famous buildings, 13 million people visit it every 
 
 year.  Countless more stand before it, tilt their heads up and gaze at the extraordinary vertical scale. The vast rose windows and the many ornate 
 
 sculptures guarding its exterior.  Gargoyles, saints and angels, all the features that make it a masterpiece of the Gothic style but few visitors 
 
 saw this.

BLACK:  A 2018 special broadcast by local network France Deux (ph) showed these images, the centuries old woodwork supporting the roof.  There`s so 
 
 much oak here its known as the forest of Notre Dame.  The same timber structures that would just a few months later feed a fire that threatened 
 
 to destroy the whole cathedral.  Notre Dame, Our Lady of Paris has stood since the 1200s`.  A building in constant evolution as artists and 
 
 craftsmen altered and repaired the structure and its decorations.  The towering timber spire now a loss to the flames was added in the 1800s`.  
 
Often a symbol and reflection of French political power, the cathedral was vandalized through the French Revolution while Napoleon Bonaparte used it 
 
 to reinstate monarchic rule with his coronation as Emperor.  Later, French Republican leaders, the nations presidents were honored here too.  This 
 
 service was for military hero and statesman Charles de Gaulle.  Notre Dame survived the violence and the occupation of war.  More recently terrorist 
 
 attacks in Paris saw it become a focus for the nations grief. 
 
An inspiration for artists across many art forms, none more important than Victor Hugo`s novel published in English as &amp;quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&amp;quot;.  
 
 Before the flames, time and weather were the cathedrals determined and powerful enemies.  Desperately needed restoration work was already 
 
 underway.  Now saving Notre Dame has become a critical goal for all of France.  In a place famed for beautiful, old buildings one stood above all 
 
 others as an icon of the nation`s story and the French people are not ready to let it go. Phil Black, CNN, London.

AZUZ:  The next U.S. presidential election is more than a year and a half away so why would we address it this far out?  Because 20 candidates 
 
 already have.  U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has filed his reelection paperwork.  He did it the day he was sworn into the presidency.  
 
 In recent months, one Republican and 18 Democrats have officially announced they`re challenging President Trump for the job and there are several other 
 
 Democrats who are thinking about joining the race.  This all culminates in the presidential election on November 3rd, 2020 and along the way voters, 
 
 events, travel and a lot of money all come into play.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You want to run for president.  Being president makes you the single most powerful person, man or woman, in the world but it`s 
 
 also a multiyear commitment that forces you to give up your personal life and any since of privacy.  And then about half the country`s going to hate 
 
 you no matter what you do.  The Constitution has only three requirements, natural born citizen, at least 35 years old, 14 years residing in the 
 
 United States but there`s so much more to it.  First, there`s the primary process.  Since only Republicans or Democrats are seen as serious 
 
 candidates you have to choose a party and get popular in that party.
 
An inspirational biography helps.  Maybe some years as governor or Senator, although even a few mayors think they`re ready this year and a Congressman 
 
 who lost a Senate race.  Might now matter since the current president had zero government experience when he ran.  You spend nearly a year bouncing 
 
 back and forth from Iowa to New Hampshire to South Carolina to Nevada.  If you`re not with voters, you`re raising money and raising money and raising 
 
 money.  It takes millions to mount a serious bid and you can only raise $2,700 per donor for the primary and $2,700 per donor for the general 
 
 election.  If you get that far. 
 
Hillary Clinton raised and spent almost $1 billion losing to Donald Trump.  He raised much less.  The primaries are expensive too.  Bernie Sanders 
 
 spent $222 million on his 2016 primary loss.  Why is it so expensive?  You`ve got to have an army of staffers and volunteers.  You have to buy TV 
 
 ads, internet ads.  In the general election, you`re going to spend every waking hour in Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, maybe Ohio, Colorado.  
 
If you want to win, you should probably visit Wisconsin.  There are debates and town halls and interview after interview after interview.  And then if 
 
 you win, you get to be president.  It means you live above the office.  You get to try to work with Congress to get something done.  Oh, and you`re 
 
 going to have to start running for reelection on day one.

AZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Before the U.S. Air Force became an independent branch of the military, under which branch was it organized?  Army, Navy, 
 
 Coast Guard, or Marines Corps.  The U.S. Air Force started as the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army`s Signal Corps.

AZUZ:  Dubai United Arab Emirates is a desert so there`s not much rain but when there is and its accompanied by thunder, the Birds Khalifa the world`s 
 
 tallest building becomes a lightening rod.  The massive jolts of electricity were diverted down to earth.  Nobody was hurt but plenty of 
 
 people shared video and pictures including Dubai`s Crown Prince.  
 
It`s not just &amp;quot;lightful&amp;quot;.  It`s &amp;quot;delightful&amp;quot;.  An illuminating jolt that brings both &amp;quot;felicity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;electricity&amp;quot;.   It &amp;quot;sparks&amp;quot; conversation and 
 
 concern.  It draws both a crowd and a &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot;.   It`s a &amp;quot;power trip&amp;quot; that trips &amp;quot;power transforming transformers&amp;quot; and bring a &amp;quot;shock&amp;quot; to all who see 
 
 it.  I`m Carl Azuz, &amp;quot;lighting&amp;quot; up another edition of CNN 10.

CARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  A new week of CNN 10 starts right now.  I`m Carl Azuz, explaining events from around the world.  Thank you for taking 10 
 
 minutes to watch.  A massive storm system welled up last week in the United States.  A nation that consistently has the most violent weather in the 
 
 world.  When we put this show together, there were 90 million people, more than a quarter of the entire U.S. population who were under the threat of 
 
 destructive weather.  In Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, at least five people were killed as the system swept across the south on Saturday and 
 
 Sunday.  
 
A tornado was spotted in southeast Alabama Sunday morning and that wasn`t the only threat.  A CNN meteorologist said the storms also carried damaging 
 
 winds and hail.  The National Weather Service warned people in the path that torrential rains could cause flash flooding in some areas.  Monroe 
 
 County, in northeast Mississippi, was hit particularly hard according to its sheriff.  He said the area was a mess after homes, businesses and a 
 
 fire station were destroyed.  
 
There was also a lot of flooding there and two states east in Georgia, tee times were scheduled earlier for The Masters golf tournament on Sunday 
 
 because heavy storms were expected to pass through later that night.  In fact, a tornado watch was issued for the city of Augusta, as well as parts 
 
 of South Carolina Sunday night.  Knowing the difference between a watch and a warning can help you know what action you should take.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When severe weather strikes, one of the most common questions we get, what`s the difference between a watch and a warning?  
 
 Well just for comparison sake let`s take this stoplight, green light, yellow light, red light.  Sometimes the National Weather Service will issue 
 
 a hazardous weather outlook, an advisory, treat this as a green light.  Know that the possibility that rough weather is there but go about your day 
 
 as you would just stay alert.  But as conditions tend to ripen, we may see a tornado watch issued by the National Weather Service. 
 
Use this with more caution.  This means conditions are favorable for tornado development and so you need to know what you should do in case a 
 
 tornado strikes.  That`s where the warning comes in.  If the radar has indicated a tornado or someone has spotted a tornado in progress, that`s 
 
 when the tornado warning is issued and you should get to your safe place immediately.  Stop what you`re doing and seek shelter.

AZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Where would you most likely find regolith?  Off Iceland`s coast, In Earth`s core, On the moon or On Jupiter`s surface.  
 
 Regolith is a loose rocky covering of a planet`s surface.  Scientists say Jupiter has no firm surface so the answer here is the moon. 
 
It launched into space in February and circled the earth several times before being sling shotted away.  It traveled a total of four million miles 
 
 and finally reached the moon but not in the way Israeli scientists hoped it would.  Their unmanned privately funded spacecraft was supposed to make a 
 
 soft controlled landing there but communication was lost when it was about 500 feet away from the moon`s surface, and it was traveling toward it at 
 
 310 miles per hour.  So, well, boom.  If it had been successful, this would have been the first time a private organization made a controlled landing 
 
 with the smallest budget.  Still the team and their nation`s leader have suggested this isn`t the end. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There were high hopes and high drama and in the end high disappointment for the people behind this ambitious 
 
 privately funded $100 million project.  From the beginning, it was the case of the little guy shooting for the moon or more precisely a soft landing on 
 
 the moon and they nearly made it with their spacecraft Beresheet which means Genesis.  There was a crowd that included the Prime Minister Benjamin 
 
 Netanyahu watching on but the team lost contact with the spacecraft in the last moments before the planned touchdown.  
 
Apparently engine problems and then the descent became uncontrollable and it crashed.  In a moment of classic understatement, one of the project 
 
 managers saying, I`m sorry to say but our spacecraft did not make it in one piece to the moon.  If they had, Israel would have been just the fourth 
 
 country to soft land on the moon after the old Soviet Union, the U.S. and China.  Still though, a major achievement for an upstart group that began 
 
 eight years ago as part of a Google competition.
 
 They didn`t make the deadline for that competition but decided to keep going with private funding and a lot of good old chutzpah and they came oh 
 
 so close to success.  Still became only the seventh country to get to the moon if not successfully land on it.  A lot of pride in Israel in this 
 
 project.  Plenty of people watching live including school kids at the president`s home and those behind the project not letting the less than 
 
 soft landing put them off.  For its part SpaceIL says quote, &amp;quot;Don`t stop believing.  We will continue to work hard.&amp;quot;  And then the Prime Minister 
 
 Netanyahu saying quote, &amp;quot; We will try again.  Next time it will be better.&amp;quot;  A sign perhaps of government involvement going forward quote, &amp;quot;I`m 
 
 seriously considering investing now in the space program.&amp;quot;  Michael Holmes, CNN, Jerusalem.

AZUZ:  Space investors from around the world will probably have a new option for getting their satellites into orbit.  It`s called Stratolaunch 
 
 and its considered to be a mega jet.  Six engines, two cockpits though only one is used to fly it.  Its wing span is 385 feet which is wider than an 
 
 American football field is long.  This plane is longer, wider and heavier than the H-4 Hercules, also known as the Spruce Goose.  And the 
 
 Stratolaunch made history Saturday morning when it lifted off the ground, got up to speeds of 173 miles per hour and climbed 15,000 feet into the 
 
 sky. 
 
But you and I aren`t going to fly it as passengers.  This thing`s designed to carry rockets loaded with satellites so they can be launched from an 
 
 altitude of 35,000 feet into orbit.  That can save money over ground based launches.  Stratolaunch was funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen who 
 
 died last October.  It does have competitions from other companies and it has a series of test flights and certifications to go through before it can 
 
 actually start working. 
 
There are an estimated 1.3 million people in America who are classified as unaccompanied youths.  One of them lost his mother when he was 12.  His 
 
 father was incarcerated when he was 13 and he didn`t have anywhere to live.  That`s a problem that Vicki Sokolik has been working to solve since 2007 
 
 when she founded Starting Right Now.  It`s an organization that`s helped more than 200 young people in Tampa Florida. 
 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 
VICKI SOKOLIK:  A homeless, unaccompanied youth is about 15 to 19 years old who is not with their parents or guardian and not eligible for foster care 
 
 because they weren`t taken from their home but rather they made the decision to leave their dangerous situation.  Most people don`t even know 
 
 these kids exist.  There`s a lot of shame that goes with being a homeless unaccompanied youth.  They hide what`s actually going on with them and so 
 
 they really become this very invisible population.
 
Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  
 
We have helped 200 unaccompanied homeless youth.  Our kids were just dealt bad hands and we help them reshuffle their deck.  
 
Do you want a pescate?  No.  Just banana bread? 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  
 
SOKOLIK:  We offer safe and stable housing, academic support, a reliable mentor in their life and all with the goal of getting each student to reach 
 
 their own full potential.  We went to great lengths to build houses to make them really feel like homes.  A lot of times, it`s a first time they 
 
 actually have a bed that they can call their own.  We look at every single student as an individual person.  If a student needs extreme academic 
 
 support?  That`s what we`re going to focus on.  If a student needs extreme therapy?  That`s what we`re going to focus on and then we help them plan 
 
 their future. 
 
OK.  So you`re still planning on going to SPC. 
 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  
 
SOKOLIK:  97 percent of our kids graduate high school and go on to their next goal.  The transformation of these kids is monumental.  They come in 
 
 so broken.  They cannot trust and I`m just one person telling them I`m going to help them.  They become softer.  It`s just great that they can be 
 
 happy and they`re be able to be kids again.  These are kids who have been told they don`t matter and their voice does matter.

AZUZ:  Airports and waterfalls seem like two things that don`t really go together but they do at Singapore`s Changi Airport.  In its new $1.3 
 
 billion shopping complex, Changi has added an indoor forest complete with an indoor waterfall.  Its more than 130 feet high making it the tallest 
 
 indoor waterfall on the planet and what better place to put it than the airport that`s been ranked the best in the world.
 
Who needs a runway when you can have a &amp;quot;spillway&amp;quot;?  Who needs a layover when you can have a &amp;quot;spray over&amp;quot;?  In the &amp;quot;concourse&amp;quot; of travel, when 
 
 people get &amp;quot;hangered&amp;quot; up by delays that seem &amp;quot;interminable&amp;quot; it`s great to have a tower of water if the tower of control gets backed up.  Maybe Changi 
 
 will become a destination of its own for some folks who just don`t want to &amp;quot;departure&amp;quot;.  This is your captain Carl Azuz landing another edition of 
 
 CNN.
