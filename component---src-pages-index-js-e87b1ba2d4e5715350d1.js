I`m Carl Azuz for CNN 10.  This date of this show is May 2, 2019, which \n \n means we`re almost exactly a year and a half from the next U.S. presidential election and 21 people have already declared their candidacy \n \n for president, in addition to the incumbent leader himself.  \n \nPresident Donald Trump filed his reelection paperwork, just hours after he was inaugurated, on January 20, 2017.  One candidate, a former governor of \n \n Massachusetts, has said he`ll challenge President Trump for the republican nomination.  And as far as democrats go, there are 20, a record number of \n \n them who`ve officially announced their candidacy.  \n \nThey include a former U.S. vice president, a number of senators and representatives, some mayors, an author, a former cabinet official.  But \n \n why are these campaigns seemingly in full-swing when we`re still more than eight months away from even the first primaries and caucuses that help \n \n determine the party nominees?  Money is one reason.  \n \nFundraising is a critical part of any presidential run, and announcing early helps candidates start getting the donations that`ll help fuel that \n \n run.  Another reason, getting their name out there.  Candidates need voters to be familiar with them, so this is a chance for presidential hopefuls to \n \n make connections well ahead of the elections.\n \nAlso, debate season is just around the corner.  It kicks off at the beginning of summer and runs through next spring.  So the candidates are \n \n working to qualify so they can get their faces and their messages on the national stage.  \n \nTen Second Trivia.  Who is the chief justice of the United States: John Roberts, Mike Pompeo, William Barr or Neil Gorsuch?  The chief justice, \n \n who`s also the chief judge of the U.S. Supreme Court is John Roberts.  \n \nThat`s a question from the civics part of the U.S. Naturalization Test, the test that someone born outside the United States takes to become a citizen.  \n \n The exam has a total of 100 questions, but only 10 of those are asked to people applying for U.S. citizenship, and they have to get at least six of \n \n the answers right.  \n \nA new law was just passed in the State of Indiana that requires all high school students there to take the Naturalization Test as part of their \n \n civics studies.  They don`t have to pass the test to graduate.  They just have to take it.  Those who support the law say they`re concerned that many \n \n American high school students wouldn`t be able to pass the test. \n \nSo they`re hoping that requiring them to take it will help solve that.  Those who oppose the law say it`s not necessary since students are already \n \n learning this information through their civics, history and social studies classes.  The law`s set to take effect next school year.  Several other \n \n states have a similar requirement in place.  \n \nToday, we decided to test you knowledge with a few more questions from the Naturalization Test.  First, who is known as the father of our country: \n \n George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, or Thomas Jefferson?  The answer: America`s first president, George Washington.\n \nNext, what are the first words of the U.S. Constitution? We hold these truths, four score and seven years ago, Congress shall make no law, or we \n \n the people?  The answer: We the people.  Finally, how many U.S. senators are there: 50, 100, 435, or 438?  The answer: 100.  Two senators for every \n \n state.\n \nForty years after the launch of 1G, meaning first-generation wireless technology, we`re standing on the threshold of 5G.  It`s going to come at a \n \n cost.  Hundreds of billions of dollars are needed to develop 5G.  There`re currently around 200,000 cell towers around America, dedicated to 4G.  \n \nExperts estimate it`ll take at least 300,000 more to manage the fifth- generation.  There`re security concerns, and there`s also the question, what do we do when our computers and smart phones just don`t work properly?  \n \n But if everything does -\n \n(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)\n \nSAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  5G isn`t just going to change your mobile internet speed.  It`s going to touch nearly everything around you.  Right, \n \n Sophia?  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It will allow everything to be connected.  I`m getting excited just thinking about it.\n \nBURKE:  Let`s take some everyday scenarios.  You leave work, you get in your car, go home, eat dinner, take that shower, and go to bed.  Well, 5G \n \n is going to change all of that.  Let`s start with the drive.  Tell me how 5G is going to change that commute home, and this bad boy.\n \nCHRISTOPH GROTE, SVP ELECTRONICS, BMW GROUP:  This car`s permanently surveying the road around and sending relevant bits of information up to \n \n the cloud, generating a true real-time map that, in turn, is pushed down to all the other cars.  Autonomous driving is not the capability of a car.  \n \n It`s really about swarm intelligence, and that`s why 5G is so crucial.\n \nLAILA WORRELL, CEO, ALTRAN NORTH AMERICA:  The real magic of 5G is in the amount of data that can be transmitted through the increased capacity, the \n \n increased bandwidth.  That really enables a whole range of applications that currently aren`t possible.\n \nBURKE:  Why in the world would you need to have data connected beehive, David?\n \nDAVID HOUGHTON, GENERAL MANAGER, ASSET TRACKING SOLUTIONS, NIMBLELINK:  Beehives, as you know, are valuable, and as such, they`re in demand.  And \n \n so, hivekeepers need to protect them.  So they use asset trackers to essentially monitor the health of the hive.  Checking into the cloud once a \n \n day, which is the industry metric for an asset tracker, this device will last 14 years.\n \nBURKE:  So really, the lesson here is 5G isn`t just about speed.  It is also about power.  On one end of the spectrum, using a ton of power.  On \n \n the other end of the spectrum, using as little power as possible to get the longest lifespan possible.\n \nWORRELL:  5G`s going to have a massive impact on people`s lives.  It`ll happen over time as the technology is deployed, and its use cases are \n \n developed.  But we`re going to see a really big advance in the quality of life that 5G can deliver for individuals.  \n \nBURKE:  But all that isn`t enough for some people with 5G rolling out others are already focused on 6G -- 6G, really?\n \nARI POUTTU, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF OULU:  Well yes, you can have smart services with (inaudible) electronics in them -- smart glasses so you can \n \n have your device everywhere.  \n \nBURKE:  When do you think that 6G will roll out?  \n \nPOUTTU:  Standardization activities are expected to start in 2028, so a couple of years after that -- 2030. \n \nBURKE:  2030.  \n \nPOUTTU:  Yes.  \n \nBURKE:  So 2019 is the year of 5G, 2030 6G.

I`m Carl Azuz at the \n \n CNN Center.  On April 30, conflicting reports were coming out about what was happening in the South American country.  \n \nDuring a protest in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, Juan Guaido, the opposition leader, who in January, declared himself the new president of \n \n Venezuela.  He said, quote, &quot;Operation Freedom has begun.  We`re going to stand here together, asking and demanding the military to join.&quot;  \n \nCNN reporters called this an escalation of Guaido`s efforts to remove Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, from power.  What we don`t know is \n \n whether this amounts to an attempted military coup, when the armed forces take action to change a nation`s government.  Guaido`s ambassador in \n \n Washington says it`s not a military coup.  \n \nHe called it a constitutional process led by the Venezuelan people, and said there`d be more events in the hours and days to come.  A Venezuelan \n \n government official also said it wasn`t a military coup.  But he told the Reuters news agency that it was another chapter in an attempted civilian \n \n coup led by Venezuela`s opposition party and supported by the U.S.\n \nSo the question here is, have members of Venezuela`s military, which have largely supported President Maduro, now join forces with the opposition \n \n protestors who want Maduro out of power.  At the time we produced this show, we didn`t have a clear answer on that.  We`ll keep you updated on \n \n what happens in the troubled South American nation.  \n \nNext story.  Earlier this month, the island nation of Philippines protested to China, because hundreds of Chinese boats were sailing near an island \n \n administered by the Philippines.  But this particular place is also in the Spratly`s Chain, a disputed area that includes manmade islands that China \n \n has built up in recent years.\n \nDespite the dispute, the president of the Philippines has strengthened his country`s relationship with China, and that country`s investments in the \n \n Philippines have caused concerns for some people there and aboard.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nMATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It was U.S. military power in the heart of the Philippines.  For decades, Clark Air Base was the largest American base \n \n outside the U.S.  Veterans Anthony Grimm and John Gilbert remember it well.\n \nANTHONY GRIMM, U.S. VETERAN:  It was a little American.  It really was.\n \nRIVERS:  The town is still called Clark, still has a VFW post, but the base is a memory.  The Americans left in 1991.  \n \nJOHN GILBERT, U.S. VIETNAM:  Well, after Vietnam, we no longer needed those bases.  They were not a critical asset.\n \nRIVERS:  So the old base sat idle for years, but not anymore.\n \nVINCE DIZON, BASES CONVERSION AND DEVELOPMENT:  So this is going to be a major hub, not just for the country but in the entire region.  \n \nRIVERS:  It`ll cover more area than Manhattan - skyscrapers, a new airport, residential, billions of dollars of investment.  And who`s helping build \n \n it?  You are seeing more of a Chinese influence here.\n \nGILBERT:  Oh, sure.\n \nGRIMM:  Oh, yes.\n \nGILBERT:  A lot of - a lot of projects.\n \nRIVERS:  Chinese money has poured into the Philippines recently, joining other firms already here.  This company, owned by Chinese government, is \n \n building a road.  A half a mile away, the steel going up isn`t from Pittsburgh.  \n \nThe fact that I`m surrounded by Chinese steel and that China is one of the biggest country investors in this new city is remarkable, given the state \n \n of relations between the Philippines and China, just a few years ago. \n \nChina-Filipino (ph) relations hit rock-bottom in mid-2016, after Manila took Beijing to international court over artificial islands China has built \n \n and militarized, not far form the Filipino coast.  About that time though, came a new president, Rodrigo Duterte.\n \nRODRIGO DUTERTE, PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES:  I announce my separation from the United States.\n \n(APPLAUSE)\n \nRIVERS:  Duterte said that in Beijing, and soon cozied up to China.  China has since pledged tens of billions of dollars to projects in the \n \n Philippines, whose supports call healthy, necessary loans.  \n \nDIZON:  The sheer scale that China brings is something that not a lot of countries can bring to any economy.  \n \nRIVERS:  But some see that spending as dangerous.  Should anything go wrong with repayments, Manila could be beholden to Beijing.  \n \nANTONIO TRILLANES, SENATOR OF THE PHILIPPINES:  It`s the ultimate symbol of the eventual subjugation of the Philippines towards China.  \n \nRIVERS:  China has doled out hundreds of billions in similar loans to developing countries across Asia and Africa, and the U.S. has warned of \n \n debt-trap diplomacy.  Beijing recently took a 99-year lease on a key port in Sri Lanka, after the government there defaulted on Chinese loans used to \n \n build it.\n \nThe Duterte administration argues the Philippines is different and faces no such threat.  Plus, the U.S. still has a defense treaty with Manila.  But \n \n in this zero-sum game for influence, when America gives room, China will try to fill that void.  \n \nMatt Rivers, CNN, Clark, the Philippines.  \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \n \nAZUZ:  Ten  second trivia. Which of these African nations borders both Lake Victoria and the Indian Ocean?  Somalia, Uganda, Ethiopia, or Kenya?  The \n \n only one of these countries that borders both of these bodies of water is Kenya.\n \nAccording to the CIA world fact book, the back bone of Kenya`s economy is agriculture. It accounts for about a third of the nation`s gross domestic \n \n product.  But tourism also factors in.  And when a married couple from the U.S. state of Nevada recently traveled to Kenya, they wanted something a \n \n little bit off the beaten path of safaris and big game hunting.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I`m Tracy Chidum (ph).\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And I`m Mark Macintyre (ph).\n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We are from Las Vegas and we came to Kenya to celebrate my 50th birthday.

And thoughtful intelligent people just love to solve problems.  So we show them problems \n \n and there response to that is how can I help.  We build schools, we employ teachers, we built a hospital. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Nice to meet you.  I wanted to make a donation to the kids for school supplies.  I didn`t want to come to Kenya for safari.  I \n \n wanted to come to Kenya for the people.  I wanted to learn about the culture because that`s not what people do.  And I love going the opposite \n \n direction. \n \nEZEKIAL KAPARSIP, HEAD TEACHER, NKILORITI SCHOOL:  The program we have with these students, they come from far.\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How far are they traveling to get there? KAPARSIP:  Some either go as far as 10 kilometers, 5 kilometers.\n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So that`s you all are working for now.  You want some place where -- so they don`t have to walk so far to go to school?\n \nKAPARSIP: Yes.\n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I remember when I went to Tanzania (ph) I was constantly asked where was I from.  And I would say, I`m sorry, what.  What \n \n part of Africa are you from.  And that`s how this all got started because I couldn`t answer that question.\n \nAnd so I did one of those DNA test, you know, so I could figure out which countries that I was from because apparently I had to be from somewhere.  \n \n When we got the results, I was from everywhere. So it`s important for me to come back because now when I get asked the question where are you from, I \n \n can say I am from here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here with great pride.\n \nTIMOTHY OLE MOSIANY, OPERATIONS MANAGER, SANCTUARY AT OL LENTILLE:  There are only two different families in the village and normally they can leave \n \n as one family and one village or friends together. \n \nWe try to encourage our guest to have fun while doing good.  At the same time they end up enjoying the place and wanting to be part of the project \n \n and be part of the community that they have come to visit.\n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  Well this is unlikely, at Ohio`s Walnut Hills High School, 17 students recently got a perfect score on the ACT.  A college admissions \n \n test.  And the school says 23 more seniors were only one point away from perfect score.  \n \nSo what.  Well according to the administrators of the test, our of the roughly 2 million students who take it every year, only 1/10 of 1 percent \n \n of them get a perfect score.  So to have 17 perfect scores at one high school is nothing short of ACTerrific.  They became number one with a \n \n number two pencil.  \n \nThey set a new standardized.  The teachers had a multiple choice of students to congratulate.  Just don`t tell a competing exam they had a \n \n scholastic aptitude for it.  That might test some nerves.

I`m Carl Azuz, at the CNN Center.  Our first story, in a \n \n part of Africa that`s still reeling from a cyclone that made landfall in March, government officials are now getting an idea of the destruction by a \n \n second major storm.  \n \nThis one was named Cyclone Kenneth.  It hit Mozambique late last week.  At that time, its wind speeds were 140 miles per hour.  That`s the equivalent \n \n of a category four hurricane, out of five, but Kenneth was the most powerful storm ever to hit Mozambique.  The nation`s government says almost \n \n 3,400 homes have been destroyed, and more than 18,000 people are displaced. \n \nAt least 38 people died.  One uniquely destructive thing about Cyclone Kenneth, it`s slow.  When a hurricane or a cyclone doesn`t pass over an \n \n area quickly, it can drop even more rain than it normally would, and that can make flooding even worse.  Over the course of this week, forecasters \n \n expect up to 20 inches of more rain.\n \nSave the Children, an international aid group, says survivors in areas of heavy damage need food, water and shelter urgently.  But workers haven`t \n \n been able to get to some areas, because rivers have flooded and covered roads.  Cyclone Kenneth killed four people on the island nation of Comoros, \n \n which is about 100 miles east off the coast of Mozambique.  \n \nThe Mozambique and island of Ibo looks like it took a direct hit.  Mozambique is not a wealthy country.  More than 46 percent of its \n \n population is estimated to live in poverty, and natural disasters like this are part of the reason.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  \n \nELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Two major cyclones hit Mozambique in just a matter of weeks.  It`s unprecedented.  And of course, as the country \n \n tries to recover from the devastation of Cyclone Idai, another stronger storm hits the northern parts of Mozambique.  Cyclone Kenneth hits the \n \n country in the early hours of Friday, and Mozambicans woke up to strong winds and heavy rainfall.\n \nBut two major cities that are very densely-populated in the northern parts of Mozambique were not as severely impacted.  The eyewitness accounts and, \n \n of course, business that we spoke to say that it wasn`t as bad as they feared and it`s basically business of usual.  But it`s 80 kilometers north \n \n of Pemba where the catastrophe did occur on the Island of Ibo.  \n \nAccording to a resort manager there, 90 percent of the homes were totally destroyed on the island.  And it seems that that is where the eye of the \n \n storm passed through. Now, remember that this part of Mozambique isn`t as densely-populated as the rest of the country.  It`s also very remote.  \n \n We`re talking about villages that are not easily accessible.\n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Which of these countries borders the Sea of Lkhostsk: China, Kazakhstan, Ukraine or Japan?  This body of water is \n \n surrounded mostly by Russia, but is also bordered by Northern Japan.\n \nEmperor Akihito was the first Japanese royal to marry a commoner.  He was the first Japanese emperor to visit China, Thailand and the Philippines.  \n \n And today, he becomes Japan`s first royal in 200 years to advocate to give up his throne.  The role of emperor is symbolic in Japan.  The decision-\n \n making power lies in the hands of its elected politicians.  \n \nBut as that symbol of national unity, Emperor Akihito has been popular, and many Japanese are sad to see him step down.  In a rare televised address in \n \n 2016, the emperor said he was worried that his age and fitness level would make it harder for him to carry out his duties as he had until then.  \n \nThe next year, Japan`s parliament passed the law that allowed him to advocate if he wanted to.  And on Wednesday, his son, Crown Prince Naruhito \n \n will become the 126th emperor to ascend to Japan`s Chrysanthemum Throne, the name given both to the emperor`s position and to his seat, used during \n \n the coronation ceremony.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nWILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Crown Prince Naruhito inherits the Chrysanthemum Throne at a time of transition for Japan.  Once the region`s \n \n economic powerhouse, today, the Japanese economy is struggling.  The population, ageing and the workforce, shrinking.\n \nThe royal family is also shrinking.  Women are leaving and giving up their official duties.  The law says if a woman marries anyone outside of her own \n \n 18-member imperial family, she automatically becomes a commoner.  A man keeps his royal status for life.  As each princess marries and becomes a \n \n commoner, the royal family keeps shrinking, fewer people to fulfill all the responsibilities.\n \nTSUNEYASU TAKEDA, AUTHOR:  You`re exactly right.  And I believe that a certain number of Imperial family members are needed, as the number has \n \n been increasing rapidly.\n \nRIPLEY:  Japan used to have many noble families, but after the war, just one.  Now, they`re the royal equivalent of an endangered species.  Japan \n \n also used to allow women to sit on the Chrysanthemum Throne, but that was centuries ago.  Today, it`s a different story.  The crown prince and \n \n princess only have one child, 17-year-old Princess Aiko. \n \nUnder current law, she cannot ascend to the throne, so her cousin, 12-year- old Prince Hisahito will be second in line after the abdication.  Conservative commentator and Imperial author Tsuneyasu Takeda argues \n \n against women reigning again.  The reason, preserving the male bloodline of the world`s-oldest, continuous, heredity monarchy.  \n \nWhy is it necessary for the - for the emperor to be a male?\n \nTAKEDA:  First, it`s essential to know why the emperor is an emperor.  I think it`s very important as an emperor, historically, is of the principle \n \n of pedigree. \n \nRIPLEY:  But does that mindset put the whole existence of the royal family at risk?  I mean what if there isn`t a male heir?  What if a male isn`t \n \n born?  Then what?\n \nTAKEDA:  This male line succession has been in effect for more than 2,000 years.  There was some periods when succession became difficult, but \n \n historically, they solved the problem, not by putting a daughter or sister of the emperor on the throne but by bringing in someone who had the male \n \n line pedigree, even if he was a distant relative.\n \nRIPLEY:  But can the Japanese public continue to accept an Imperial family, perceived by some as outdated, out of touch?   The Japanese government will \n \n soon discuss whether succession law needs to change.  Some argue, if it doesn`t, the Imperial family faces an uncertain future.\n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  When someone is set to receive an organ transplant, doctors have only a matter of hours to get the organ to the recipient.

Welcome to everyone watching worldwide.  It`s great to see you this Monday.  The month \n \n of April is drawing to a close and this Friday the first Friday of the new month, the U.S. governments latest jobs report is due out.  It will look at \n \n economic indicators like the unemployment rate.  The percentage of the American workforce that doesn`t have a job.  For the past two months it`s \n \n been at 3.8 percent considered a very low rate and a good sign for the economy.  The report monitors whether wages are growing and by how much.  \n \n Wage growth can be a good sign and it will examine the number of jobs that were added to the economy in April.\n \nThat`s statistic has been a rollercoaster this year.  Hiring boomed in January with more than 300,000 jobs added.  The number dropped dramatically \n \n in February with less than 35,000 added and it bounced back in March with just under 200,000 new jobs.  Predicting what the economy will do, how much \n \n it will grow is done by looking at information like this and by reading the trends in the U.S. stock market.  Christine Romans from CNN Money explores \n \n how it continues to rise and what could slow that down in the months ahead. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nCHRISTINE ROMANS, ANCHOR OF CNN MONEY:  Resilience is still the word in stocks after one of the best first quarters in years.  April brings the \n \n major U.S. averages close to record highs.  This year the NASDAQ is up more than 20 percent, the S&amp;P 500 up 16 percent, the Dow up 13 percent.  The Dow \n \n is now up more than 40 percent since the election.  Now so far the beginning of earnings season hasn`t changed this narrative.  Yes, profit \n \n growth is expected to turn negative in the first quarter but guess what?  Investors largely saw that coming.  \n \nThe U.S. economy is growing and the job market is strong.  Wages are beginning to pick up but overall inflation is low.  There`s enough \n \n confidence in the markets and the economy to bring a wave of tech start ups public, so called &quot;unicorn&quot; parade of IPOs.  Ten years into an economic \n \n expansion and J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told shareholders the expansion could run for years more.  What could go wrong?  Well plenty.  \n \n The early benefits of new tax laws in the U.S. are beginning to fade, rising gas prices could bite consumers.  Oil prices are up 35 percent this \n \n year and the average price of gas in the U.S. jumped almost 10 cents in a recent week.\n \nAmerica`s trade wars are ongoing and trade talks unfinished.  Beware of breakdown in trade talks with China or a worsening trade situation between \n \n the U.S. and it`s largest trading partner the European Union.  President Trump has until May to decide whether to slap tariffs up to 25 percent on \n \n European car imports.  Any of these factors could make the historic stock market run a lot more vulnerable. \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  According to the Pew Research Center, 77 percent of Americans have what?  Is it a smartphone, landline, dog or passport?  \n \n Smartphones are the answer here and cell phones in general are owned by 95 percent of Americans. \n \nA debate is raging over kids and screen time.  How much of the day they should spend in front of TVs, smartphones, tech?  The World Health \n \n Organization recently released guidelines on this.  It says for young kids, screen time needs to be limited to an hour a day or less.  That`s similar \n \n to a recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  Experts say too much screen time early in life is associated with delays in language \n \n skills, social skills, even the brain`s ability to think.  But there are other studies that suggest limited screen time, especially with educational \n \n apps or programs can encourage creativity and sometimes problem solving skills.  So the research is mixed.  In some classrooms for older kids, \n \n administrators have found a place for artificial intelligence.  What`s not known is whether this could be a substitute for old school education. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A timeless scene that has been played out in schools around the world for centuries.  Young students enjoying their break \n \n between lessons.  But back in the classroom of this school in Abu Dhabi, a transformation is happening.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In this lesson, you learn to solve equations with rational coefficients.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whiteboards, markers and books have been replaced with interactive calendars, digital avatars and laptops.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Let`s solve this equation together. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fourteen year old Mari Amahamad (ph) is just one of 25,000 students in the UAE and the U.S. being taught through the Olive \n \n Education Platform.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When you are using books it was like so boring, so it`s nice to use (inaudible) traditional way.\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Founded in Abu Dhabi in 2015, the online program is using technology to disrupt traditional education in the classroom.  \n \n Children are encouraged to create their own avatar.  And through the use of videos, animation, digital content and questions along the way, the Olive \n \n Platform aids learning.  At its headquarters in Abu Dhabi in a secure control room, analysts use artificial intelligence to make sense of the \n \n reams of information coming in.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We capture millions of data points on a daily basis.  The human cannot process that many data points. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The premise is simple.  If a pupil struggles with a concept, the system adapts and presents the lesson again in a form more \n \n tailored to the student.  The result is reframing the future of education. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wouldn`t it be great if you could look at artificial intelligence and data to drive kids into the right careers, into the right \n \n choices post secondary education?  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When it comes to adopting AI technology, the United Arab Emirates is one country leading the way.  But with artificial \n \n intelligence expected to generated $96 billion towards the economy by 2030, some are worried that this technology comes at a cost, with a growing \n \n debate over whether the benefits outweigh increased screen time for children or potential privacy concerns.  \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that one in 59 children in America has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.  It can \n \n involve problems communicating, bonding emotionally or repeating the same behaviors.  Dr. Wendy Ross was named a CNN Hero in 2014 for her work to \n \n help children on the spectrum take part in every day activities.  Now she`s helping the medical industry better understand patients with Autism \n \n Spectrum Disorder. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nDR. WENDY ROSS:  Hey.  How are you?  Hi, Alex (ph).  Patients coming in on the spectrum may have a more difficult time communicating.  Those with \n \n autism also have heart attacks or cancer and without doctors that can understand how to interact with them, they`re not going to get appropriate \n \n healthcare. \n \nAlex, I know you`ve been using the letter board but can you tell me, what was it like to be unable to communicate for so long?  \n \nMy patient Alex Lapeck (ph), despite being nonverbal actually has an IQ that is very, very high.  \n \nALEX TRANSLATED:  It was frustrating.  I had some tough days but the first time I spelled openly, I knew my life had changed forever.  \n \nROSS:  You never want to underestimate somebody`s ability but then again doctors need to understand for someone on the autism spectrum who doesn`t \n \n often look at faces.  That pain scale, that`s not really a good way of monitoring their pain.  Some of the accommodations that our program \n \n provides are noise cancelling headphones.  Things like fidgets to help reduce their anxiety.  We are really providing autism friendly healthcare.  \n \n What would you like to tell other people about you and other people on the spectrum?  \n \nALEX TRANSLATED:  They are so thirsty to learn.  Our brains are like sponges.  \n \nROSS:  Alex has a lot to say and so he`s really become a huge part of our program in terms of consultation, on making things autism friendly.  What \n \n was the moment, like, when you realized that other people could understand you?\n \nALEX TRANSLATED:  It was like the Eagles winning the Super Bowl. \n \nROSS:  We want those on the spectrum to exceed everyone`s expectations including their own and we would like to exceed everyone`s expectations in \n \n the care that we deliver.  \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  A lot of kids with dogs know the animals only wish they could ride the school bus.  Now, they can.  A man in Portland, Oregon offers a service \n \n that picks up pups in a custom van.

One difference between this and school recess though, sometimes kids are allowed to join the animals on \n \n a play date.  \n \nSo in this case the kids and the van have gone to the dogs.

Fridays are awesome.  Shakespeare couldn`t have said that any better.  I`m \n \n Carl Azuz for CNN 10.  We`re grateful to have you wrapping up the week with us.  We start with a milestone for the measles.  This year there`ve been at \n \n least 681 cases of the disease stretched across 22 U.S. states.  That`s the highest number on record since the measles was declared eliminated from the \n \n U.S. in the year 2000.  Being eliminated doesn`t mean its completely gone, it means the country went more than 12 months without people continuously \n \n catching the disease.\n \nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control says the current outbreaks are linked to people who traveled to other countries and brought the measles back with \n \n them.  No one has died in the outbreaks.  Most of children who`ve been infected were not fully vaccinated against the measles though some were and \n \n caught it anyway.  The vaccine offered in America isn`t just for the measles.  It`s called MMR, standing for measles, mumps, and rubella.  The \n \n three diseases it aims to prevent.  Doctors recommend two doses of this vaccine in early childhood.  \n \nThe CDC says there`s a remote chance that the MMR vaccine can cause side effects and even serious injuries which is why some parents are holding off \n \n on getting it for their children.  But experts say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.  Measles is highly contagious.  Symptoms \n \n include high fevers, coughing, and a skin rash.   \n \n10 Second Trivia.  Which of these U.S. cities was founded in 1625?  New Amsterdam, St. Augustine, Savannah, or Jamestown.  What`s now New York City \n \n was originally founded by 17th century Dutch settlers, hence the name New Amsterdam.  \n \nIn the late 17th century, what had become the city of New York had an estimated population of less than 8,000 people.  Today that populations \n \n more than 8 million.  It`s the most populated city in America but that`s not its only change.  The island of Manhattan has grown, vertically of \n \n course with skyscrapers but outwardly as well as dirt and the garbage generated by all those people was used to expand the area they could live \n \n on.  Today we`re joining a local architecture critic for a tour of New York City`s ever changing waterfront. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We can only think of New York as having five burroughs, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.  But there`s \n \n really a sixth burrough and it`s the largest which is the water that connects the other five.  So the first pier in New York started right here.  \n \n Standing here you don`t really feel like you`re in a maritime city.  You don`t feel like you`re close to the water but in New Amsterdam days this \n \n was really the edge of Manhattan and everything from here to what is now the river is landfill. \n \nIt`s really the most profitable kind of recycling.  If you take garbage, put in the water and turn it into real estate.  One of the best places to \n \n get a sense of how the city has changed and the waterfront has changed is right here, Pier 15.  It`s a wonderful example of the way, a relatively \n \n small, relatively modest design intervention can create a space people really didn`t know about.  So this is Swasen`s Landing, this is the entry \n \n point to Governor`s Island and if you take the ferry from Manhattan it`s just a five minute ferry ride.  Everybody disembarks here and then finds \n \n their ways to different points on the island. \n \nAnd there`s a map which shows you the two parts of the island.  The original Governor`s Island, which was where the Dutch first settled, and \n \n then all of this is landfill.  I`m here in Brooklyn Bridge Park which is a wonderful place to tell the story of New York`s tempestuous love affair \n \n with the water and the waterfront.  And right where we`re standing here was just a oily, polluted shoreline isolated behind chain link fences that you \n \n really couldn`t access.  It was really kind of an abandoned area of the city.  \n \nNow thanks to 20 years of - - of landscaping of (inaudible), this park is now full of people.  It`s a destination park not just a neighborhood park.  \n \n To me this story of New York re-embracing its waterfront is a very optimistic one.  It`s not just about the waterfront.  It`s really about the \n \n idea of seeing some of the hardest hit areas of the city.  Some of the weaknesses and finding the imagination and the long term commitment to \n \n build something new.  \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  Picking back up today on our Positive Athlete Series.  It features people like Caden Westwick (ph), a volleyball player in California.

You can see on the trees the mudslide was like 15 feet high.  You can see the mark \n \n of the mud and we pretty much just went in there and tried to clear it all out.  I lost, well, for one just my school backpack, all my textbooks.  I \n \n mean, everything in my room, all my clothes, my bed.  I mean, even just stuff that I like to use like my camera, sports - - like volleyballs, \n \n sports equipment.  It`s a little challenging but its pretty rewarding just because I feel like I`m helping the community after all the help they gave \n \n me. \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  In part of Lincoln, California, thousands of sheep are typically brought in to chew up grassland before fire season begins.

Finally when Scott Russo (ph) assumed the role of shepherd and \n \n led them back through the gate, while his wife jumped on the trampoline and shook a tambourine the sheep retreated.  \n \nOf course the gate is now in &quot;sheep shape&quot; and the shepherd broke a sweater to make them &quot;evacuate&quot;.

It shares a tiny 11 mile stretch of land with Russia \n \n and that`s what North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Un crossed this week for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  They`re scheduled to meet \n \n Thursday in the city of Vladivostok.

China is North Korea`s only real trading partner.

Twenty of the victims have \n \n been hospitalized but no one has died.  There`s a ground beef supplier in Georgia that`s recalled more than 113,000 pounds of raw ground beef because \n \n of possible e coli contamination.

You`re not going to get sick but there are some strains that can get you sick e coli O157H7 is a particularly dangerous strain of e \n \n coli.  You can get it from undercooked ground meat.  You can get it from vegetables, from unpasteurized milk, in juice, from soft cheeses.  While it \n \n is found in vegetables, ultimately an animal is the source.  So animal waste some how has come in contact with crops.  \n \nChildren and adults with weakened immune systems, they`re the most vulnerable to getting very sick.  The signs of e coli poisoning are nausea \n \n and vomiting, abdominal pain, cramps, fatigue and fever.  Most people who get sick from e coli, they recover in five to 10 days but some people they \n \n get really sick.  Their organs can shut down and they can die.  There are things that you can do to prevent an e coli infection.  Wash your fruits \n \n and vegetables.  Cook your meats thoroughly, use a thermometer and get that thermometer up to 160 degrees.

The likely \n \n reasons why are our first topic today on CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.  Welcome to the show.  U.S. economy is strong.  Unemployment is near a record low \n \n point.  So more people will be looking to travel this summer.  Jet fuel prices have increased and they`re expected to get higher.  That can limit \n \n the routes the airlines will want to take since some won`t be as profitable and that can increase ticket prices.  And then there are issues with \n \n Boeing, one of the worlds biggest airplane manufacturers has had its best selling passenger jet grounded around the world. \n \n371 planes, all of them in Boeing 737 Max series were taken out of service last month.  That happened after two catastrophic crashes, one near \n \n Indonesia in October and one in Ethiopia in March.  Everyone aboard those flights was killed.  Boeing`s been working to improve the safety of its 737 \n \n Max series planes.  After they were grounded, the company had to temporarily stop delivering them to the airlines that ordered them.  That \n \n hurt Boeing significantly because most of the money for a plane is paid when it`s actually delivered.  \n \nThose deliveries are expected to pick back up later this year when the 737 Max aircraft are approved to fly again.  The impact on Boeing`s finances \n \n could become clearer on Wednesday when it releases its latest financial report.  The impact on Boeing`s reputation is harder to and it`s difficult \n \n to say when either of these challenges will be overcome. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Only weeks away from the start of the summer travel season, and there`s no end in sight to Boeing`s woes.  The entire fleet of \n \n 737 jets still grounded.  In the U.S., American Airlines and Southwest are canceling hundreds of flights through August.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It`s our responsibility to eliminate this risk.  We own it and we know how to do it. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Boeing said it would shrink monthly production of all 737s by 20 percent while it works to deliver a software fix for the Max.  \n \n Last week, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said that work was almost done. \n \nDENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO OF BOEING:  I had the opportunity to participate in another demonstration flight that saw first hand this software in its final \n \n form operating as designed across a range of flight conditions. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The pressure from investors is building upon Boeing.  Shares are down nearly 15 percent since the start of March. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The company`s going to be extremely keen to get the existing fleet air born and to get deliveries of the - - the Max on the \n \n production line underway.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The software fix is just the start of the long road back for Boeing. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You`re looking at emanate resolution the next couple of weeks.  What really matters though is getting all the regulatory bodies out \n \n there on the world - - in the world comfortable with this fix and willing to implement it and that could take several additional months. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Wall Street believes that even when the 737 Max`s are back in the air, Boeing still has a host of problems.  Bank of America \n \n downgraded the company citing the cost of penalties owed to customers, a weaker negotiating position with airlines and operational inefficiencies \n \n from the production disruption.  Returning the fleet to service will be a hard sell for a public that`s weary of Boeing`s promises on safety. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think there`s going to be an emphasis on hey, is - - is there an across the board culture problem here.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This has been a crisis of confidence in Boeings planes and one that won`t be solved neither cheaply or easily. \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Name the longest reigning monarch in British history.  Queen Elizabeth II, Queen Victoria, King George III, or King \n \n Henry VIII.  Queen Elizabeth II, the nation`s current monarch, is reigned more than 67 years.  The longest reign in British history. \n \nThe queen is planning to host U.S. President Donald Trump for a state visit this spring.  The United States and the United Kingdom, two close allies, \n \n both made that announcement yesterday.  The event is scheduled for June 3rd through 5th.  The White House says it`s an opportunity to reaffirm the \n \n steadfast relationship between the two countries.  British Prime Minister Teresa May said it would also be a chance to strengthen their cooperation \n \n in trade, investment, security and defense. \n \nA state visit is a very formal event.  In Britain, it typically includes a horse parade and royal banquet.  Only two other U.S. presidents have been \n \n invited to one since the queen ascended to the throne in 1952.  She first sent the American leader an invitation two years ago.  The countries have \n \n been trying to work out the date since then.  \n \nAccording the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, more than 50 percent of the garbage that Americans generate winds up in a landfill.  The good news \n \n is, recycling and composting rates in America have increased dramatically since the 1980s.  The EPA estimates that more than a third of the trash we \n \n produce gets recycled or composted.  The bad news is, there`s still a lot of recyclable material that`s thrown away and what might be the unexpected \n \n news is that we`ve got to pay closer attention to what goes where.  A lot of garbage that looks recyclable actually isn`t and it can cause problems \n \n for the facilities that process it. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you were thinking about putting that paper coffee cup into the recycling bin, you could be making the planets waste problem \n \n even worse.  Some items that might seem right for recycling actually aren`t.  It`s called &quot;wish-cycling&quot; and it`s a big problem for waste \n \n management companies.  Why?  Well recycling centers collect and sort items, then bundle the matching materials into large bales to sell back to the \n \n companies that make new products out of those materials. \n \nIf non-recyclable trash ends up in those bales, they are considered contaminated and the entire bale is taken to the dump wasting hundreds of \n \n pounds of quality material.  Some common contaminants are coffee cups, plastic bags, greasy pizza boxes, non-recyclable plastics.  Pizza boxes can \n \n only be recycled if they are not soiled by grease or food residue.  Plastic bags are not accepted at curbside bins because they clog up the sorting \n \n machines.  However, they can be returned to many grocery stores to be properly recycled.  \n \nRemember to look for the recycling symbol on items and check your local guidelines online before trying to recycle something.  This is important \n \n because items like glass bottles, Styrofoam and plastics grade three through seven are not accepted at all recycling centers and could become \n \n contaminants.  It`s going to take us all a little bit of working together and making an earnest effort to help keep our planet healthy and beautiful.  \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  Today`s 10 out of 10 segment concerns the worlds slowest mammal.

I`m Carl Azuz, thank you for taking 10 minutes for our show.  An \n \n island country in the Indian Ocean is the scene of today`s first story.  \n \nThe nation of Sri Lanka is reeling from a series of terrorist attacks that targeted churches and hotels on Easter Sunday.  At least 290 people were \n \n killed and 500 or more were injured with the coordinated attacks took place.\n \nMost of them happened in the same timeframe between 8:45 and 9:30 on Sunday morning. Suicide bombers detonated their explosives at three churches \n \n across the country.  \n \nAt around the same time more explosions took place at three luxury hotels in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo and later on Sunday there was a blast \n \n at a hotel near a zoo and a final explosion happened in a private house as police were raiding it in connection with the previous attacks.\n \nOfficials don`t know yet why Christians were targeted.  Easter is their most important holiday but Christians are a religious minority in Sri \n \n Lanka.  They account for about 7.5 percent of the population.\n \nBuddhist make up 70 percent.  Hindus make up 12.5 percent and Muslims make up a little under 10 percent.  The Sri Lanka says its concern that an \n \n international terrorist group is behind the assault.  \n \nWhen we produced this show, no organization had admitted carrying them out but as Sri Lankan government spokesman says there were warnings days before \n \n that attacks that something was going to happen and the government admitted yesterday that it failed to act on those warnings.\n \nThe Sri Lankan is on edge after a series of deadly terror attacks that ripped across parts of this country.  This church, St. Anthony Shrine, one \n \n of three Catholic churches targeted on Easter Sunday.  You can still see shattered glass here.\n \nAnd the clock tower frozen at roughly the time when a suicide bomber attacked during Easter Sunday prayers.  And in the 24 hours since, the \n \n authorities are not taking any chances.  Look just down this road here you can see the remains of a suspicious vehicles that an explosive disposal \n \n team detonated on Monday afternoon sending real fear through an already traumatized community.\n \nThis has been a series of deadly attacks; hundreds of people killed and wounded.  There has been criticism that the security forces missed a \n \n warning from a foreign intelligence agency about threats of suicide attacks against Catholic churches prompting one government minister to accuse some \n \n of these security chiefs of incompetence and negligence.\n \nAnd also prompting a government spokesperson to publically apologize for letting this potentially crucial data of intelligence slip through the \n \n authority`s fingers.  In the meantime, there has been no official claim of responsibility.  And some of the victims are still fighting for their lives \n \n in the intensive care units of Sri Lankan hospitals.\n \nSome leaning (ph) U.S. law makers spend Monday reviewing the Mueller report we mentioned last week.  The results of a special investigation led by \n \n former FBI director, Robert Mueller.\n \nThe full report was released to Congress on Thursday but it had some redactions, some edits and a less edited version was given to House and \n \n Senate leaders yesterday.  One main focus of the report concerned Russia.  Did the campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump illegally coordinate with \n \n the other country to win the election.\n \nThe report said no that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian government.  Another part of the report concerned the U.S. leader`s \n \n actions.  Did President Trump illegally interfere with the Mueller investigation and commit the crime of obstruction of justice.  \n \nThe report was more vague on that.  Investigators said they couldn`t conclude for sure that the president committed a crime but that they also \n \n couldn`t conclude for sure that he didn`t.  It suggested that Congress could make its own investigation into that.\n \nHow politicians reacted to all this mainly depended on what political party they`re in.  President Trump and other republicans say the report \n \n vindicates the president.  That he didn`t illegally cooperate with Russia and that it`s time to move on.\n \nDemocrats have said they need to see the full Mueller report without redactions and that Congress now needs to investigate whether the president \n \n committed obstruction of justice.  We don`t know yet what the next steps will be in all this but we`ll keep you updated.\n \n(BREAK)\n \nTen second trivia, which of these U.S. cities is located the farthest west?  San Diego, California; Los Angeles, California; San Francisco, California; \n \n or Seattle, Washington?  With 122.4 degrees west, just a tiny bit farther than Seattle is San Francisco, California.\n \nKnown as the city by the bay, San Francisco attracts tens of millions of people every year. That makes tourism the city`s biggest industry. That \n \n industry is facing a number of challenges.  Homelessness is ramped throughout San Francisco.  So is drug use and the presents of drug \n \n materials.  Many of the people who`ve traveled there in recent years have complained of feeling unsafe.  \n \nStill tourism brings billions of dollars into the city every year.  People marvel at the Golden Gate Bridge. They imagine what it`d be like to try to \n \n escape from Alcatraz and some to the braver drivers test their skills on Lombard Street.\n \nA stretch of it has a 27 degree grade with sharp curves because paving it straight up and down in 1922 would have made it too steep for the cars of \n \n that era to climb.  Lombard Street has another problem today though.  The sheer number of people who want to visit it.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nUNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  From draw (ph) view seven it`s easy to see why the crooked street attracts of tourist but from the ground residents have a \n \n different perspective.\n \nUNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  I moved here probably two years and it was nothing like this then. \n \nUNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  Gray Brunges (ph) says something has to be done to deal with the massive growth of tourist especially over the past 10 years.\n \nUNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  Something (inaudible) that in itself is an issue.\n \nUNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  They have to be acutely aware of how it impacts our residents.\n \nUNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible) solution, setting up a reservation system and charging visitors $5 to drive the crooked road.  \n \nUNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  This is how it works; register online, pick a day and time to visit, when your number`s called .\n \nUNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  A license plate reader would verify it`s your time and then enjoy the ride.\n \nUNIDIENTIFIED MALE:  Watch out, watch out.

Welcome to a special edition of CNN 10.  \n \nDo you know that expression &quot;you are what you eat&quot;?  \n \nWell, CNN has a &quot;Raw Ingredient&quot; series.  It looks at how the U.S. food industry has changed, how engineering and importing have replaced old-\n \n fashioned growing and how consumer demand still factors in to how the industry produces our food.  \n \nOur reporter Cristina Alesci has gone inside some of America`s biggest food companies, seeing most people haven`t seen before.  \n \nAnd today, we`re zooming in on animal feed and how what they eat ultimately makes its way to our plate.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n \nCRISTINA ALESCI, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  I know I`m not supposed to do it, but every once in a while, it`s necessary -- burying my \n \n face in the best barbecue I can find.\n \nAmericans eat a lot of meat.  On average, up to 126 pounds of poultry, beef and pork every year.  For some, it`s more than their own body weight.  \n \nBut depending on the animal, producing one pound of meat can take two, three, or even six pounds of feed.  And what some of our livestock is \n \n eating are things you`d never put in your mouth.\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We`re going this way.\n \nALESCI:  This is a hog finishing farm in Iowa.  It`s where pigs get fat.  \n \nOver the course of five to six months, pigs go from about 13 pounds to 270 pounds in this room.  \n \n(on camera):  Why did they get all quiet of a sudden? \n \nDAVID CALDERWOOD, PORK PRODUCER:  They want to hear what I have to say.  \n \nALESCI:  Wow, that`s amazing.  \n \n(LAUGHTER)\n \nALESCI (voice-over):  The smell was awful, but, for me, the most unsavory part of this process is the one you rarely get to examine closely.  In \n \n fact, it`s one of the most opaque corners of the meat industry.  It`s the animal feed itself.  \n \nMost animals raised in this country eat a secret formula.  Some elements of the mix are even unknown to the farmer. But it`s safe to say that it \n \n includes proteins, fats, and in many cases, drugs.  But the base for much of it is lots and lots of corn.\n \n(on camera):  Do you feel like this is what you were born to do?\n \nROGER ZYLSTRA, CORN FARMER:  I feel this is what God put me on the earth for.\n \nALESCI (voice-over):  Roger Zylstra has been farming corn for more than 30 years.  \n \n(on camera):  This corn is not corn wheaties.\n \nZYLSTRA:  No.\n \nALESCI:  It`s not corn I put on my grill.\n \nZYLSTRA:  No, it is not.  We grow it as a commodity.  It really ultimately comes down to economics.  \n \nALESCI (voice-over):  And if it wasn`t for the meat industry, Roger might have a time staying in business, that`s because America`s livestock are \n \n essentially just corn conversion machines.  \n \nFirst, the corn travels to a storage facility like this one.  This is one million bushels, or 56 million pounds of corn.  And that`s just the \n \n overflow from the massive storage containers.\n \nJIM MAGNUSON, GENERAL MANAGER, KEN COOPERATIVE:  We need to hold a whole year`s worth of production at one time and then it`s metered out throughout \n \n the remainder of the year.\n \nALESCI:  Nearly 40 percent of all the corn grown in the U.S. goes to animal feed.  \n \nRick Weigel makes hog feed.  \n \n(on camera):  How many ingredients are looking at the end of the day?\n \nRICK WEIGEL, HOG FEED PRODUCER, KEN COOPERATIVE:  Probably 10 to 12 different ingredients in.  \n \nALESCI (voice-over):  That includes pig fat.  So, yes, the pigs are eating pig fat.\n \nOne of the biggest feed-makers is 250 miles north, Cargill, in Minnesota.  \n \nSARENA LIN, PRESIDENT, CARGILL ANIMAL AND NUTRITION:  We believe our purpose here is to be able to feed the world.  And to feed the world, we`ve \n \n got to find the most efficient way to grow healthy animals.  So, we spend a lot of time doing the research to tackle exactly that question.  \n \nALESCI:  Cargill says it can get animals just as fat on half the feed compared to 40 years ago.  \n \nBut for many in the industry, it`s not just about less feed.  It`s about bigger animals.  \n \nHow do you get livestock to explode in size in a few months?  The industry has a term for it -- renderings.  Animal byproducts like meat and bone \n \n meal, leftover grease from restaurants, and even meal made from poultry feathers.  \n \nKEEVE NACHMAN, PHD, CENTER FOR A LIKABLE FUTURE, JOHNS HOPKINS:  To get a chicken to market weight, it takes between 42 and 48 days.  I mean, that`s \n \n amazingly fast.\n \nALESCI:  Dr. Keeve Nachman investigates the impact of industrial food production on public health at Johns Hopkins.  One of his studies found \n \n arsenic in chicken meat.  It came from a growth promotion drug in feed that has since been suspended by the FDA.\n \nIn another study, Nachman`s team found that some chicken feather meal contain small amounts of the active drugs in Tylenol, Benadryl and Prozac.  \n \nAn industry group rejected the findings, but Nachman stands by it.\n \nNACHMAN:  No matter how they got there, these feathers are destined for use in animals.  That was surprising and a little troubling to us.\n \nALESCI:  Some producers even use waste, feeding cows and pigs what`s known as poultry litter, or simply put, chicken poop, which believe it or not is \n \n considered a high protein, lower cost feed.\n \nThe FDA proposed banning the practice in 2004 to prevent mad cow disease.  The FDA decided against the regulation.  It said the science simply didn`t \n \n justify a ban.  The FDA estimates that 1 percent of all chicken poop goes into feed.  \n \nBut none of the farmers I interviewed said they used it.\n \nAnd there`s one more ingredient that`s essential to getting growth out of animals.  \n \n(on camera):  Where are the drugs? \n \nWEIGEL:  They are in the drug room.  We hand-weigh them out and they`re dumped in each batch of feed.  \n \nALESCI (voice-over):  Weigel says the majority of his customers request antibiotics in their feed.  This is where it comes from. \n \nWe asked Keeve Nachman about the drugs we saw in this room.\n \nNACHMAN:  I did see one drug that has an active ingredient called carbadox that has been shown to be carcinogenic and cause birth defects, at least in \n \n animals.  And that drug has been banned in Canada, in the E.U., and in Australia.\n \nIt`s still approved for use here.\n \nALESCI:  But with some restrictions, which Weigel says he follows closely.\n \nAnd get this: More than 70 percent of all antibiotics sold in the U.S. are for food production animals. \n \nJEFF DUNN, PRESIDENT, CAMPBELL`S FRESH:  When I tell people 75 percent of the antibiotics in this country go into the animal supply chain, it blows \n \n their mind.  It`s not possible.  How can that be?  \n \nAntibiotics are for humans.  It`s just not possible.  I mean, that blows their mind.  \n \nALESCI:  Jeff Dunn is trying to reform the food industry from the inside, at Campbell`s.\n \n(on camera):  Why is that important?  Why should people care about that process?\n \nDUNN:  Because the process --  \n \nALESCI:  For those who don`t care.  Because clearly there`s a subsection of society that does care, but there`s tons of other people that don`t care?\n \nDUNN:  All of this costs money.  You know, none of this stuff comes free, and there`s a reason that amount of antibiotic was used by the meat \n \n industry, because it was effective for them, it was efficient for them.  \n \nUltimately, if the low cost food requires us to do these things to animals in our food system that aren`t long-term healthy, how about we really \n \n simply just externalize that costs than the long term health issues?\n \nALESCI (voice-over):  Here`s why using so many antibiotics is a problem:\n \nAntibiotics are vital drugs that can help us to defend from bacteria that make us sick, or even kill us.  \n \nBut bacteria can evolve.  Every time we use antibiotics, some bacteria survive and those drug resistant bacteria can then multiply and spread.  \n \n This can result in what many call a superbug.  \n \nAs we use more and more antibiotics, this problem magnifies, generating more kinds of superbugs and making the ones that already exist even more \n \n powerful.  \n \nThere are already some strains of drug-resistant bacteria out there and public health officials warn it will only get worse if we don`t cool it on \n \n the antibiotics.  \n \nThe FDA says it`s changing antibiotic guidelines for animal feed by December 2016.  Veterinarians will have to make sure the drugs are used \n \n judicially and, quote, when needed for specific animal health purposes.\n \nThe feed-makers I spoke to said they follow FDA regulations.  But Nachman isn`t satisfied with the FDA or the industry.  \n \nBut is there an alternative?  Maybe going organic.\n \nJAMES PETERSON, FARMS ORGANIC CORN AND SOYBEANS:  We are farming the same way that my great grandparents would have farmed.\n \nALESCI:  Without drugs, the same pound of meat will cost you more.\n \nPETERSON:  The consumers are willing to pay.  I think there will be -- continue to be more demand. \n \nALESCI:  And there`s the heart of it, demand for cheap meat.

I`m Carl Azuz.  \n \nToday, we`re taking a look at inside the U.S. food supply, this time, zeroing in on produce.  We`re examining how engineering and importing have \n \n replaced old fashion growing in the U.S. food industry, and how consumer demand still has the power to influence the industry.  \n \nOur reporter Cristina Alesci has gone inside some of America`s biggest food companies, seeing what most folks haven`t seen before and getting \n \n incredible insight as to how production affects what`s on our plate.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n \nCRISTINA ALESCI, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Salad.  Americans are eating up to five times more leafy greens than they did 20 years ago.  \n \n We`re consuming three billion pounds a year.  But our intensifying love affair with fresh produce is creating problems for farmers, for the \n \n environment, and even for our own health.  \n \nOne in six Americans, that`s 48 million people, get sick from contaminated food each year, 3,000 die.  That you think it`s coming from undercooked \n \n meat and fish.  Well, produce is actually responsible for about half of the illnesses.  \n \nMANSOUR SAMADPOUR, PHD, PRESIDENT, IEH LABORATORIES:  Any industry that wants to produce safe foods, they can do that.  \n \nALESCI:  Dr. Mansour Samadpour runs one of the nation`s largest food safety consulting labs.  Chipotle recently hired his company to assess and improve \n \n safety standards after the government traced an outbreak of E. coli back to some of its stores.  He stocks listeria and salmonella in his office.  \n \nSAMADPOUR:  This plate in theory is good enough to infect everyone in the city of Seattle.\n \nALESCI (on camera):  How could you get so close to it?  \n \nSAMADPOUR:  Because they don`t jump.  \n \nALESCI (voice-over):  Recently, the risk associated with some fruits and vegetables has become so high that the FDA begun actively monitoring them \n \n for contaminants, a historic move for the agency.\n \nSo, how serious is the industry when it comes to keeping our food safe?\n \nWe traveled across the country to find out.  \n \nIt`s sunrise in Salinas Valley, California.  This area is called the &quot;Salad Bowl of America&quot; and for good reason.  Its fields produce 60 percent of the \n \n leafy greens in the U.S.  \n \nDIRK GIANNINI, FARMER:  I think farmers are the backbone of this nation, to be honest.\n \nALESCI (on camera):  I climb up on this side, right?\n \nSo, this is water that did this, that cut this?\n \nGIANNINI:  Yes, it`s a water knife with extreme amount of pressure.  We`re trying to attract better workers and a better working environment for our \n \n employees.\n \nALESCI (voice-over):  Dirk`s family has been farming this land for four generations.\n \nGIANNINI:  The amount of work that goes behind one head of lettuce is tremendous and the basic consumer has no idea of the intensity and the \n \n dedication to a 10-acre block of romaine.\n \nALESCI:  Farming in this part of the world has gotten really rough.  Farmers are fighting a drought, a labor shortage and rising prices for \n \n land, even some insiders say the industrial process is pushed to the brink.  \n \nThe president of Campbell`s Fresh is one of them.\n \n(on camera):  What is the state of the food system?\n \nJEFF DUNN, PRESIDENT, CAMPBELL`S FRESH:  I would say that it`s highly stressed.  The past 50 years of over-farming a lot of land has created real \n \n problems on the global basis in terms of having enough irrigable farmland.  The word I`ve used is stressed almost from any dimension you look at.\n \nALESCI (voice-over):  And farming is just the beginning of the process.  And yes, I mean, process.\n \n(on camera):  How cold is it in there?\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It`s going to be about 34 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit in there.  The entire process is that cold.  \n \nALESCI (voice-over):  Taylor Farms is the largest producer of fresh cut vegetables in the world.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Any given day, we`re going to have a million pounds of product come through this cooler.\n \nALESCI (on camera):  A million pound?\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A million pound of products.\n \nALESCI:  Wow.\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whether we dice, shred or shock, they`re going through several series of cutters and they immediately fall down into the beginning \n \n of our wash process.\n \nBRUCE TAYLOR, FOUNDER AND CEO, TAYLOR FARMS:  It kills Gram-negative bacteria, which is the bad stuff.  So, E. coli, salmonella and listeria.\n \nALESCI (voice-over):  Taylor spent millions on the so-called smart wash system after spinach from another California company caused 200 people to \n \n get sick and killed three.\n \nTAYLOR:  You can`t eliminate -- there`s no kill stuff in our industry yet.  It`s still fresh products, so you can`t cook it or microwave it, or to do \n \n something like that.\n \nALESCI (on camera):  How much of a setback was the outbreak in 2006 of E. coli?\n \nGIANNINI:  I think that was a wake up call. \n \nALESCI (voice-over):  Beyond the human costs, it was a $300 million setback to the industry.\n \nSAMADPOUR:  The current assumption is that the food is safe until proven otherwise.  We have made a lot of people sick over the years.  \n \nALESCI (voice-over):  You may be asking, how does a bacteria like E. coli or salmonella end up in your leafy greens?  It could be a variety of ways, \n \n but the most common answer is waste.  \n \nManure is used to fertilize crops.  Animals like rodents or birds pick up the bacteria and then carry it into produce fields.  \n \nSAMADPOUR:  People really need to understand what they are eating, where it has been grown.  You`re planning to travel to a country and they say, when \n \n you go there, don`t eat salads and don`t drink water.  And then you find out that your salad is coming from that place.  \n \nALESCI:  And an appetite for year-round produce means the imports just keep coming.\n \nTOM NASSIF, PRESIDENT AND CEO, WESTERN GROWERS:  Well, they always produces, but it wasn`t the kind of importing that`s being done now.  Every \n \n year, we import more and more fresh produce from foreign countries.  We found that in many of the outbreaks, it comes from foreign producers.\n \nALESCI:  The government is trying to hold foreign producers to a higher standard, with the Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA -- the most \n \n significant food safety law in 70 years.  The bill sets guidelines for how companies should prevent and respond to contamination.  \n \nIt sounds great.  The problem: funding.\n \n(on camera):  How much more does the FDA really need to do its job right?\n \nSAMADPOUR:  Much more than what they have been asking for.\n \nALESCI:  How much more?\n \nSAMADPOUR:  Say they need probably minimum 10 times more resources, 10 times more resources.\n \nALESCI (voice-over):  The agency says it needs about $170 million more.  A lack of money and people might be one of the reasons the FDA has stopped \n \n short of requiring routine government inspections of farms, according to critics.  Instead, it relies on third party auditors.  But the agency says \n \n the new law gives the industry an accountability that didn`t exist before.  The goal it says is getting safer food to you.  \n \nBut with 48 million people getting sick each year, and an estimated $77 billion in costs, the price of failure is high.\n \n(on camera):  Fresh food, it`s what everyone wants to eat more of, and the key to the healthy diet.  And technically, it`s supposed to make shopping \n \n more simple.  There isn`t a laundry list of ingredients on a bag of carrots, right?  \n \nBut sometimes, shopping for raw ingredients could actually be more confusing than buying the packaged and processed stuff.  So, let me bring \n \n it down for you.\n \n(voice-over):  After reporting &quot;Raw Ingredients&quot;, people said, great, now that you`ve scared us, what can we buy that`s safe in the grocery story?  \n \n Should you buy organic produce?\n \nWell, it kind of depends.  The government tracks chemical residues on our fruits and vegetables.  The worst culprits: apples, berries, cucumbers and \n \n spinach.  It might be worth paying a premium for those.  \n \nOr you could stick to fruits and vegetables that have fewer chemical deposits.  Think onions, sweet corn, cabbage and eggplant.  The cleanest: \n \n avocados.\n \nThere is an emerging alternative, hydroponics, growing produce without soil, which is supposed to be much cleaner than an open field.\n \n(on camera):  Fish, you want it low in contaminants and high in omega 3s, the good fatty acids.  \n \n(voice-over):  Seafood like mackerel, shrimp and wild salmon.\n \nOr look for pull caught fish.  Those tend to be younger, so they spent less time exposed to toxins. \n \n(on camera):  But what if your local store only stocks farm-raised salmon?\n \n(voice-over):  Those can be higher in industrial chemicals stored in fish bag.  But experts say you can remove most of the bad stuff like trimming \n \n away or cooking off the fat.\n \n(on camera):  But enough with the veggies and fish, how about the meat?  Now, the ideal here is, find some companies that minimize antibiotics.\n \n(voice-over):  The CDC says that all those drugs in our meat have created a public health threat known as a super bug.  So, look for these labels.  \n \n These third parties are supposed to ensure farmers are using drugs responsibly.\n \nAnd here are a few marketing scams you should watch out for.  Terms like &quot;natural and farm raised&quot;.  Those don`t tell customers whether living \n \n conditions for the animals are horrendous or pristine.\n \nAnd while &quot;hormone free&quot; chicken sounds great, the FDA bans those in chickens, turkeys and hogs.\n \n(on camera):  Bottom line: eat fresh food, just ask a few more questions.\n \n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n \nEND    \n \n",url:"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1904/19/sn.01.html"},{date:"2019-04-18",title:"Lawmakers Await Full Results of Mueller Investigation; CNN Reveals How Venezuela Has Become Route for Illegal Drug Smugglers",content:"\nCARL AZUZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Welcome to a new edition of CNN 10.  I`m Carl Azuz.  Happy to see you this Thursday.  There is some news expected out of \n \n Washington, DC today.  It concerns the Mueller Report, the special investigation by former FBI Director Robert Mueller.  It looked into \n \n alleged Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election of 2016.  The Justice Department already released a summary of the report to \n \n Congress, that happened last month.  It said the investigation did not find that the campaign of Donald Trump illegally conspired or coordinated with \n \n Russia.  The Mueller Report didn`t draw a conclusion about whether President Trump obstructed justice, if he illegally interfered with \n \n government work. \n \nBut the summary said the U.S. Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General both concluded that there wasn`t sufficient evidence that the president had \n \n done anything wrong.  So what`s happening today?  Well Democrats said the four page summary wasn`t enough.  They wanted to see the entire Mueller \n \n Report of more than 300 pages.  That`s expected to be released today, though it`s also expected to be redacted meaning parts of it will likely be \n \n edited or removed first.  CNN 10 is planning to follow up on this story next week. \n \n10 Second Trivia.  Which of these countries won its independence from Spain in 1811?  Brazil, Haiti, Venezuela, or Jamaica.  Only one of these \n \n countries that won its independence from Spain is Venezuela.  \n \nVenezuela`s leader is starting to let humanitarian aid into the country.  For years, President Nicolas Maduro has denied that there`s a crisis in \n \n Venezuela but this week his government allowed the Red Cross to make its first delivery there.  The United Nations estimates that more than 20 \n \n percent of Venezuelans are in desperate need of supplies like medicine.  With its economy in shambles, a CNN investigation just found that illegal \n \n drug trafficking through Venezuela is soaring.  The country accuses the U.S. and Colombia of trying to distract attention toward Venezuela to hide \n \n their own defeat in the war on drugs.  But Nick Paton Walsh found first hand how Venezuela is becoming a major currier of cocaine. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nNICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Below is a cocaine super highway enriching Venezuela`s corrupt elite by (ph) bringing \n \n coke to American streets.  These thin lines are secret pathways from Colombia`s cocaine farming heartland below, across into neighboring \n \n Venezuela.  From there billions of dollars of the drug are smuggled north in tiny planes, U.S. and regional officials told CNN aided by Venezuela`s \n \n army and elite.  The Colombian military we`re with don`t get any lower to stay out of the range of track (ph) and machine guns and talk to locals \n \n mostly through the leaflets they drop. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We`ve stopped drug flights out of Colombia he told me but not from places we don`t control.  \n \nWALSH:  He means Venezuela, just five miles away.  Below they think they`ve spotted a cocaine laboratory one of many fueling Venezuela`s role as a \n \n cocaine courier.  Which a CNN investigation has learned is booming just as the country collapses, 240 tons went from Colombia to Venezuela in 2018.  \n \n After a third (ph) in one year, a U.S. official told us which could fetch $40 billion on U.S. streets.  That traffic happening down below, one \n \n possible (inaudible) why do many in the Venezuelan army and government never (inaudible) give up on Nicolas Maduro . They`re simply making too \n \n much money. \n \nThe trade remains mostly secret inside Venezuela on the other side of the border here but we were able to learn more about these illegal routes in \n \n from recent defectors from the Venezuelan army border patrol.  And about how their officers ordered them to let cross specific trucks carrying \n \n cocaine.  For five years this sergeant got those orders often three times a week.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE TRANSLATED:  The cars that cross both weapons and drugs were pick ups and we would be told the color and make of the truck and \n \n when, usually just after dawn or dusk.  Everything was coordinated by the brigade commander.  He`d send a lieutenant to tell you what needed to cross \n \n and this was arranged high up above.  Those who didn`t agree were swapped out automatically.  \n \nWALSH:  He fled to here, Colombia when the pressure to comply got too much and his unit found themselves confined to base.  \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE TRANSLATED:  We were locked on the base.  The general would say, everyone must be with us.  Leave or speak against the \n \n government, you`ll get arrested.  They had us brainwashed with food handouts.  One night I couldn`t take it anymore.  I went home and told my \n \n wife, we leave for Colombia.  My son started crying and said, Dad what are we going to do?  But I knew if they stayed without me they`d be captured or \n \n interrogated.  \n \nWALSH:  Venezuelan state TV occasionally shows how their armed forces crack down on the trade here intersecting Mexican pilots that have previously \n \n rejected allegations their actually running the drugs.  And then they`ll respond to several requests for comment.  But a U.S. official has told CNN \n \n these flights are surging, they use to take off from the remote hidden runways in the southern Venezuelan jungle but in the last three years moved \n \n north a U.S. official told CNN to reduce flying time.  There used to be three a week but last year there were almost daily.  This year, they`ve \n \n seen as many as eight in a single day a regional official said using 50 hidden runways.  \n \nCNN has seen a confidential U.S. radar map approximately here that shows the sharp turn left of planes from Venezuela take before landing on the \n \n remote Central American coast line off of Honduras before the cocaine travels north through Mexico to the United States.  Honduras is where we \n \n pick up the trail of this booming traffic again on the coastline below turned into a surreal graveyard of narco planes.  Cocaine cargo they carry \n \n is worth so many millions the plane itself is just a fraction in a billion dollar deal.  So, many are discarded (inaudible) all over the jungle or \n \n crammed here into one river bend. \n \nThe troops we`re with don`t want to be on camera for their safety.  Some of these have their markings torn off to make the job of working exactly where \n \n they come from even harder.  America`s drug habit is where the money, the route (ph), all begins.  But that same open market also supplies a key part \n \n of the logistics here.  When the fires deprived most of this plane of kind of distinguishing characteristics but you can still see N4 there.  N \n \n meaning this plane originated in the United States.  Brokers, a U.S. official tells me, buy up dozens of old planes at auction in the United \n \n States and hide their ownership in shell companies to send them south to start the cocaine journey north from Venezuela. \n \nAgain, another N, which means another plane that started its days in the United States.  It`s not just traffickers in Venezuela and the U.S. making \n \n billions, the entire region is in on it.  This is surely Honduras` biggest industry, the billions at stake everywhere.  From this jungle road which is \n \n actually a hidden runway up to the Honduran president`s brother indicted last year on trafficking charges which he denies.  You can`t stop the \n \n planes being sold or taking off one officer tells me.  So they instead just have to try and make landing harder by blowing holes in the runways.  Just \n \n in slowing down this multibillion dollar trade requires so many more holes to be blown in this vast expanse of jungle. \n \nThe amounts of money cocaine brings here literally dwarfs any effort to fight it.  Insane amounts of cash and to some villages along this coastline \n \n that have none.  In fact, the Honduran army tells us traffickers flying towards these villages often kick their cargo overboard when they think \n \n they`re about to be intercepted.  Each 30 kilogram bundle of cocaine is attached to floats and then drifts ashore.  They then pay these communities \n \n of fishermen $150,000 for each recovered bundle.  It`s calculus for corruption that most officials I spoke to admit they (inaudible) and that \n \n no police or aid operation can really hope to challenge. \n \nOne that sees the collapsing Maduro government has the alleged couriers cashing in  fast in a region of desperate (inaudible). \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)   \n \nAZUZ:  At first this will look like your run of the mill pontoon boat hanging out on a lake.  Nothing really unusual here until we zoom out and \n \n now you see the problem.  There was no one aboard the boat.  No lives were threatened here.  Officials believe that recent severe storms in the area \n \n caused the boat to break loose and drift to the edge of a dam.  Once the weather calmed down, wildlife officers used an electric wench to pull the \n \n boat back to shore. \n \nAll hands on deck to stop a &quot;shipwreck&quot;, to keep the &quot;boat afloat&quot;, a &quot;tact to stay intact&quot;.

There was a lot saved.  The two towers and facade at the front, what many people envision when they think of Notre Dame, they`re \n \n still standing.  A Paris city hall spokesperson says the cathedrals most significant treasures were saved including what Notre Dame calls its most \n \n precious and venerated relic.  A crown of thorns which many believe is the crown of thorns that was placed on the head of Jesus Christ.\n \nThe chaplain of the Paris fire service is being called a hero for rescuing that and other artifacts and the cathedrals great organ is safe.  Scores of \n \n the relics that survived were taken to the Louvre Museum, what was lost the cathedral`s spire, large parts of its roof and it`s ancient vaulted \n \n ceiling.  The central part of the building was damaged.  The Paris Fire Brigade says it`s not known yet what caused the fire.  A French government \n \n spokesman says it could be months before the full scope of the damage is known and a restoration expert expects it will take 10 to 15 years to fully \n \n rebuild Notre Dame. \n \nThe Vatican has offered its technical expertise in restoring the medieval catholic church and as far as funding goes, French philanthropists and \n \n businesses have pledged more than $700 million in donations to restore the cathedral.  That gives you one sense about what Notre Dame means to France.  \n \n Here`s another.  Victor Hugo`s novel, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; became the best selling book on Amazon France shortly after the fire took place.  \n \n A different edition of the same novel was the second best selling book, for a third sense of the building`s significance here`s CNN`s Phil Black. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nPHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  How do you measure the profound value of one old building to a nation or to the world?  Perhaps when people stop in \n \n the street to weep and pray because of its partial destruction, when the French president openly shares that grief. \n \nFRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON:  (untranslated)\n \nBLACK:  And efforts to save it are broadcast everywhere.  Notre Dame is among the most famous of famous buildings, 13 million people visit it every \n \n year.  Countless more stand before it, tilt their heads up and gaze at the extraordinary vertical scale. The vast rose windows and the many ornate \n \n sculptures guarding its exterior.  Gargoyles, saints and angels, all the features that make it a masterpiece of the Gothic style but few visitors \n \n saw this. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (untranslated)\n \nBLACK:  A 2018 special broadcast by local network France Deux (ph) showed these images, the centuries old woodwork supporting the roof.  There`s so \n \n much oak here its known as the forest of Notre Dame.  The same timber structures that would just a few months later feed a fire that threatened \n \n to destroy the whole cathedral.  Notre Dame, Our Lady of Paris has stood since the 1200s`.  A building in constant evolution as artists and \n \n craftsmen altered and repaired the structure and its decorations.  The towering timber spire now a loss to the flames was added in the 1800s`.  \n \nOften a symbol and reflection of French political power, the cathedral was vandalized through the French Revolution while Napoleon Bonaparte used it \n \n to reinstate monarchic rule with his coronation as Emperor.  Later, French Republican leaders, the nations presidents were honored here too.  This \n \n service was for military hero and statesman Charles de Gaulle.  Notre Dame survived the violence and the occupation of war.  More recently terrorist \n \n attacks in Paris saw it become a focus for the nations grief. \n \nAn inspiration for artists across many art forms, none more important than Victor Hugo`s novel published in English as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;.  \n \n Before the flames, time and weather were the cathedrals determined and powerful enemies.  Desperately needed restoration work was already \n \n underway.  Now saving Notre Dame has become a critical goal for all of France.  In a place famed for beautiful, old buildings one stood above all \n \n others as an icon of the nation`s story and the French people are not ready to let it go. Phil Black, CNN, London.\n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  The next U.S. presidential election is more than a year and a half away so why would we address it this far out?  Because 20 candidates \n \n already have.  U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has filed his reelection paperwork.  He did it the day he was sworn into the presidency.  \n \n In recent months, one Republican and 18 Democrats have officially announced they`re challenging President Trump for the job and there are several other \n \n Democrats who are thinking about joining the race.  This all culminates in the presidential election on November 3rd, 2020 and along the way voters, \n \n events, travel and a lot of money all come into play.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You want to run for president.  Being president makes you the single most powerful person, man or woman, in the world but it`s \n \n also a multiyear commitment that forces you to give up your personal life and any since of privacy.  And then about half the country`s going to hate \n \n you no matter what you do.  The Constitution has only three requirements, natural born citizen, at least 35 years old, 14 years residing in the \n \n United States but there`s so much more to it.  First, there`s the primary process.  Since only Republicans or Democrats are seen as serious \n \n candidates you have to choose a party and get popular in that party.\n \nAn inspirational biography helps.  Maybe some years as governor or Senator, although even a few mayors think they`re ready this year and a Congressman \n \n who lost a Senate race.  Might now matter since the current president had zero government experience when he ran.  You spend nearly a year bouncing \n \n back and forth from Iowa to New Hampshire to South Carolina to Nevada.  If you`re not with voters, you`re raising money and raising money and raising \n \n money.  It takes millions to mount a serious bid and you can only raise $2,700 per donor for the primary and $2,700 per donor for the general \n \n election.  If you get that far. \n \nHillary Clinton raised and spent almost $1 billion losing to Donald Trump.  He raised much less.  The primaries are expensive too.  Bernie Sanders \n \n spent $222 million on his 2016 primary loss.  Why is it so expensive?  You`ve got to have an army of staffers and volunteers.  You have to buy TV \n \n ads, internet ads.  In the general election, you`re going to spend every waking hour in Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, maybe Ohio, Colorado.  \n \nIf you want to win, you should probably visit Wisconsin.  There are debates and town halls and interview after interview after interview.  And then if \n \n you win, you get to be president.  It means you live above the office.

I`m Carl Azuz, explaining events from around the world.  Thank you for taking 10 \n \n minutes to watch.  A massive storm system welled up last week in the United States.  A nation that consistently has the most violent weather in the \n \n world.  When we put this show together, there were 90 million people, more than a quarter of the entire U.S. population who were under the threat of \n \n destructive weather.  In Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, at least five people were killed as the system swept across the south on Saturday and \n \n Sunday.  \n \nA tornado was spotted in southeast Alabama Sunday morning and that wasn`t the only threat.  A CNN meteorologist said the storms also carried damaging \n \n winds and hail.  The National Weather Service warned people in the path that torrential rains could cause flash flooding in some areas.  Monroe \n \n County, in northeast Mississippi, was hit particularly hard according to its sheriff.  He said the area was a mess after homes, businesses and a \n \n fire station were destroyed.  \n \nThere was also a lot of flooding there and two states east in Georgia, tee times were scheduled earlier for The Masters golf tournament on Sunday \n \n because heavy storms were expected to pass through later that night.  In fact, a tornado watch was issued for the city of Augusta, as well as parts \n \n of South Carolina Sunday night.  Knowing the difference between a watch and a warning can help you know what action you should take.\n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When severe weather strikes, one of the most common questions we get, what`s the difference between a watch and a warning?  \n \n Well just for comparison sake let`s take this stoplight, green light, yellow light, red light.  Sometimes the National Weather Service will issue \n \n a hazardous weather outlook, an advisory, treat this as a green light.  Know that the possibility that rough weather is there but go about your day \n \n as you would just stay alert.  But as conditions tend to ripen, we may see a tornado watch issued by the National Weather Service. \n \nUse this with more caution.  This means conditions are favorable for tornado development and so you need to know what you should do in case a \n \n tornado strikes.  That`s where the warning comes in.  If the radar has indicated a tornado or someone has spotted a tornado in progress, that`s \n \n when the tornado warning is issued and you should get to your safe place immediately.  Stop what you`re doing and seek shelter.  \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  10 Second Trivia.  Where would you most likely find regolith?  Off Iceland`s coast, In Earth`s core, On the moon or On Jupiter`s surface.  \n \n Regolith is a loose rocky covering of a planet`s surface.  Scientists say Jupiter has no firm surface so the answer here is the moon. \n \nIt launched into space in February and circled the earth several times before being sling shotted away.  It traveled a total of four million miles \n \n and finally reached the moon but not in the way Israeli scientists hoped it would.  Their unmanned privately funded spacecraft was supposed to make a \n \n soft controlled landing there but communication was lost when it was about 500 feet away from the moon`s surface, and it was traveling toward it at \n \n 310 miles per hour.  So, well, boom.  If it had been successful, this would have been the first time a private organization made a controlled landing \n \n with the smallest budget.  Still the team and their nation`s leader have suggested this isn`t the end. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nMICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There were high hopes and high drama and in the end high disappointment for the people behind this ambitious \n \n privately funded $100 million project.  From the beginning, it was the case of the little guy shooting for the moon or more precisely a soft landing on \n \n the moon and they nearly made it with their spacecraft Beresheet which means Genesis.  There was a crowd that included the Prime Minister Benjamin \n \n Netanyahu watching on but the team lost contact with the spacecraft in the last moments before the planned touchdown.  \n \nApparently engine problems and then the descent became uncontrollable and it crashed.  In a moment of classic understatement, one of the project \n \n managers saying, I`m sorry to say but our spacecraft did not make it in one piece to the moon.  If they had, Israel would have been just the fourth \n \n country to soft land on the moon after the old Soviet Union, the U.S. and China.  Still though, a major achievement for an upstart group that began \n \n eight years ago as part of a Google competition.\n \n They didn`t make the deadline for that competition but decided to keep going with private funding and a lot of good old chutzpah and they came oh \n \n so close to success.  Still became only the seventh country to get to the moon if not successfully land on it.  A lot of pride in Israel in this \n \n project.  Plenty of people watching live including school kids at the president`s home and those behind the project not letting the less than \n \n soft landing put them off.  For its part SpaceIL says quote, &quot;Don`t stop believing.  We will continue to work hard.&quot;  And then the Prime Minister \n \n Netanyahu saying quote, &quot; We will try again.  Next time it will be better.&quot;  A sign perhaps of government involvement going forward quote, &quot;I`m \n \n seriously considering investing now in the space program.&quot;  Michael Holmes, CNN, Jerusalem. \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  Space investors from around the world will probably have a new option for getting their satellites into orbit.  It`s called Stratolaunch \n \n and its considered to be a mega jet.  Six engines, two cockpits though only one is used to fly it.  Its wing span is 385 feet which is wider than an \n \n American football field is long.  This plane is longer, wider and heavier than the H-4 Hercules, also known as the Spruce Goose.  And the \n \n Stratolaunch made history Saturday morning when it lifted off the ground, got up to speeds of 173 miles per hour and climbed 15,000 feet into the \n \n sky. \n \nBut you and I aren`t going to fly it as passengers.  This thing`s designed to carry rockets loaded with satellites so they can be launched from an \n \n altitude of 35,000 feet into orbit.  That can save money over ground based launches.  Stratolaunch was funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen who \n \n died last October.  It does have competitions from other companies and it has a series of test flights and certifications to go through before it can \n \n actually start working. \n \nThere are an estimated 1.3 million people in America who are classified as unaccompanied youths.  One of them lost his mother when he was 12.  His \n \n father was incarcerated when he was 13 and he didn`t have anywhere to live.  That`s a problem that Vicki Sokolik has been working to solve since 2007 \n \n when she founded Starting Right Now.  It`s an organization that`s helped more than 200 young people in Tampa Florida. \n \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \nVICKI SOKOLIK:  A homeless, unaccompanied youth is about 15 to 19 years old who is not with their parents or guardian and not eligible for foster care \n \n because they weren`t taken from their home but rather they made the decision to leave their dangerous situation.  Most people don`t even know \n \n these kids exist.  There`s a lot of shame that goes with being a homeless unaccompanied youth.  They hide what`s actually going on with them and so \n \n they really become this very invisible population.\n \nHello.  Hello.  Hello.  \n \nWe have helped 200 unaccompanied homeless youth.  Our kids were just dealt bad hands and we help them reshuffle their deck.  \n \nDo you want a pescate?  No.  Just banana bread? \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  \n \nSOKOLIK:  We offer safe and stable housing, academic support, a reliable mentor in their life and all with the goal of getting each student to reach \n \n their own full potential.  We went to great lengths to build houses to make them really feel like homes.  A lot of times, it`s a first time they \n \n actually have a bed that they can call their own.  We look at every single student as an individual person.  If a student needs extreme academic \n \n support?  That`s what we`re going to focus on.  If a student needs extreme therapy?  That`s what we`re going to focus on and then we help them plan \n \n their future. \n \nOK.  So you`re still planning on going to SPC. \n \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  \n \nSOKOLIK:  97 percent of our kids graduate high school and go on to their next goal.  The transformation of these kids is monumental.  They come in \n \n so broken.  They cannot trust and I`m just one person telling them I`m going to help them.  They become softer.  It`s just great that they can be \n \n happy and they`re be able to be kids again.  These are kids who have been told they don`t matter and their voice does matter.  \n \n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n \nAZUZ:  Airports and waterfalls seem like two things that don`t really go together but they do at Singapore`s Changi Airport.  In its new $1.3 \n \n billion shopping complex, Changi has added an indoor forest complete with an indoor waterfall.  Its more than 130 feet high making it the tallest \n \n indoor waterfall on the planet and what better place to put it than the airport that`s been ranked the best in the world.\n \nWho needs a runway when you can have a &quot;spillway&quot;?  Who needs a layover when you can have a &quot;spray over&quot;?  In the &quot;concourse&quot; of travel, when \n \n people get &quot;hangered&quot; up by delays that seem &quot;interminable&quot; it`s great to have a tower of water if the tower of control gets backed up.  Maybe Changi \n \n will become a destination of its own for some folks who just don`t want to &quot;departure&quot;.  This is your captain Carl Azuz landing another edition of \n \n CNN.\n \nEND    \n \n",url:"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1904/15/sn.01.html"}]}}}}}]);
